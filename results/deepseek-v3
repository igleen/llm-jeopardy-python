0 True ['Bogart'] The last name you're looking for is **"Bogart"**, as in the legendary Hollywood icon **Humphrey Bogart**. 

The verb *"to bogart"* means to selfishly hog or monopolize something (like a joint or food), which is indeed not cool. It's said to originate from Bogart's on-screen habit of keeping a cigarette dangling from his mouth for long periods without smoking it. 

So, while Bogart himself was ultra-cool, the verb inspired by his name describes the opposite behavior!
1 True ['Fiji'] The South Pacific country you're referring to is **Fiji**. 

Although Fiji has more than 300 islands, about **70% of its population** lives on its largest island, **Viti Levu**, where the capital city, **Suva**, and the major urban centers like **Nadi** and **Lautoka** are located. The second-largest island, **Vanua Levu**, is home to a smaller portion of the population. The remaining islands are much less populated. 

Would you like more details about Fiji's geography or demographics?
2 True ['Calder'] This quote from *The Quotable Alex* touches on a fundamental shift in artistic philosophy—the idea that art should not be confined to static forms but embrace movement as an essential dimension. The statement aligns with the evolution of kinetic sculpture and dynamic art forms that emerged prominently in the 20th century, challenging traditional notions of permanence and stillness in art.

### Key Interpretations:
1. **Rejection of Stasis**: The quote critiques the conventional view of sculpture (and art broadly) as fixed, unchanging objects. It suggests that art should reflect life’s dynamism, energy, and temporality.  
2. **Kinetic Art**: The "next step" likely references kinetic sculpture, where motion (mechanical, natural, or illusionary) becomes integral to the work. Artists like Alexander Calder (with his mobiles), Naum Gabo, and Jean Tinguely pioneered this, blending art with engineering and time.  
3. **Engagement and Interaction**: Motion invites viewer interaction or responds to environmental forces, making art more participatory and alive.  
4. **Metaphorical Motion**: Beyond literal movement, it could imply art that evolves conceptually or digitally (e.g., generative art, VR), breaking boundaries of physicality.  

### Deeper Implications:
- **Art as Process**: Echoes futurist and constructivist ideas that art should mirror modernity’s speed and innovation.  
- **Temporal Dimension**: Motion introduces time as a medium, transforming sculpture into a 4D experience.  
- **Democratization**: Kinetic art often requires less elitist materials, aligning with avant-garde movements that sought to dissolve art/life divides.  

Alex’s quote is a provocation—an invitation to see art not as a frozen monument but as a living, breathing entity in dialogue with space, time, and its audience. Would this perspective extend today to digital or AI-driven art, where "motion" is limitless?
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] The medieval alchemical substance you're referring to, often called the "tincture" and believed to have the power to transmute base metals into gold, is the **Philosopher's Stone** (known as the **Sorcerer's Stone** in the U.S. edition of *Harry Potter*). 

In alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone was a legendary substance said to enable not only the transmutation of metals but also the creation of the **Elixir of Life**, granting immortality. In *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, Nicolas Flamel (a real historical alchemist) is depicted as having created the Stone, which Voldemort seeks for its life-extending and gold-producing properties.

So, if Harry Potter wanted to turn metals into gold, the Philosopher's Stone would indeed be his best bet!
4 True ['Leontyne Price'] The self-titled 1961 LP of arias sung by **Leontyne Price** is known to opera lovers as the *"Blue Album."*  

Leontyne Price, one of the greatest American sopranos of the 20th century, recorded this iconic album early in her career, showcasing her powerful and expressive voice in a selection of operatic arias. The album's striking blue cover earned it its nickname among fans.  

Would you like recommendations for standout tracks from this recording?
5 True ['Space Station'] Commander Sheridan and the crew of *Babylon 5* lived and worked aboard the **Babylon 5 space station**, a massive, self-contained artificial habitat located in neutral space near the planet Epsilon Eridani. 

The station itself was a **five-mile-long rotating cylinder**, divided into multiple sections (or "sectors") that housed living quarters, command centers (like **Brown Sector** and **Blue Sector**), diplomatic areas (such as the **Ambassador's Wing**), commercial zones (**Zocalo**), and even a **Down Below** slum area. Key locations included:

- **Command & Control (C&C)**: The nerve center where Sheridan, Ivanova, and others managed station operations.  
- **Medlab**: Dr. Franklin's medical facility.  
- **The War Room**: A secret area for planning against the Shadows.  
- **Quarters**: Personal living spaces (Sheridan's had a memorable fish tank).  
- **Docking bays**: For starships like the *White Star*.  

The station was a **melting pot of alien species** (Minbari, Narn, Centauri, etc.) and served as a hub for diplomacy, intrigue, and warfare during its five-year arc. Unlike *Star Trek*'s starships, *Babylon 5* was a **static (but politically volatile) "city in space"**—more akin to a frontier outpost than a vessel.  

Fun fact: The station's design (by Ron Thornton) emphasized realism, with **rotating sections for artificial gravity** and a gritty, lived-in aesthetic.
6 True ['Tyler'] The President who served alongside a running mate that also fought in the **War of 1812** (besides William Henry Harrison himself) was **John Tyler**.  

Here’s the breakdown:  
- **William Henry Harrison** (9th President) was a general in the War of 1812, notably at the Battle of the Thames.  
- His running mate and successor, **John Tyler** (10th President), served as a captain in the Virginia militia during the war, though he did not see major combat.  

They were elected together in **1840** on the Whig ticket ("Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"). Harrison died just 31 days into his term, making Tyler the first vice president to assume the presidency due to the death of his predecessor.  

No other presidential ticket in U.S. history featured two men who both fought in the War of 1812.
7 True ['Elvis Costello'] The Brit who collaborated with Burt Bacharach on the album *Painted from Memory* (1998) is **Elvis Costello**. 

Costello, known for his work in rock, new wave, and various other genres, co-wrote and sang on the album, which blended Bacharach's signature sophisticated pop with Costello's lyrical depth. The collaboration was critically acclaimed, and younger musicians have cited both artists as influences.
8 True ['Corinth'] The isthmus you're referring to is the **Isthmus of Corinth**, which connects the **Peloponnese** peninsula to the **Greek mainland**. 

The ancient and modern city located near this isthmus is **Corinth** (Greek: Κόρινθος, Kórinthos). 

- **Ancient Corinth** was a major city-state in classical Greece.  
- **Modern Corinth** (New Corinth) is a city rebuilt after an earthquake in 1858, located a few kilometers northeast of the ancient site.  

The **Corinth Canal**, completed in 1893, cuts through the isthmus, providing a crucial maritime shortcut between the **Gulf of Corinth** and the **Saronic Gulf**.
9 True ['The Woman in White'] In Wilkie Collins's novel *The Woman in White*, the mysterious Anne Catherick strongly favors the color **white**. This preference is significant to the plot, as her repeated appearances in white clothing contribute to her ghostly, enigmatic presence and tie into the novel's themes of identity and deception. 

The title of the novel itself is derived from Anne Catherick's association with white, as she is first encountered by the protagonist, Walter Hartright, dressed entirely in white on a moonlit road.
10 True ['Eucalyptus'] The strong-smelling tree oil in **Vicks VapoRub** is **eucalyptus oil**.  

Vicks VapoRub's key active ingredients are:  
- **Menthol**  
- **Camphor**  
- **Eucalyptus oil**  

These ingredients work together to provide a cooling sensation, relieve congestion, and soothe coughs. The strong, aromatic scent of eucalyptus oil is a defining characteristic of the product.
11 True ['Run Interference'] The football-related idiom you're thinking of is **"run interference."**  

In American football, "running interference" refers to a player (often a blocker) clearing the way for a teammate (like the ball carrier) by obstructing or distracting opponents.  

Figuratively, the idiom means **to help someone by removing obstacles or handling difficulties on their behalf**, allowing them to proceed smoothly.  

Example:  
*"The manager ran interference for her team, dealing with the client's complaints so they could focus on the project."*  

Would you like other examples or variations of this phrase?
12 True ['Virginia Woolf'] The woman whose story *Kew Gardens* was illustrated by her sister Vanessa Bell is **Virginia Woolf**.  

*Kew Gardens* (1919) is a short story by Woolf, and Vanessa Bell—her sister and a prominent artist—created woodcut illustrations for the original Hogarth Press edition. Both sisters were key figures in the **Bloomsbury Group**, an influential circle of writers, artists, and intellectuals in early 20th-century Britain.
13 True ['Fait Accompli'] The 2-word phrase in French that means "concluded fact" or "established fact" is **"fait accompli."**  

It refers to something that has already happened or been decided and cannot be changed, often implying that acceptance is the only remaining option.  

Example:  
*"They presented the decision as a **fait accompli**, leaving no room for debate."*  

Would you like additional context or usage examples?
14 True ['Arsenic'] Before penicillin, **salvarsan** (also known as **arsphenamine**), a compound containing the poisonous element **arsenic**, was used to treat syphilis. Salvarsan was developed by **Paul Ehrlich** and **Sahachiro Hata** in 1909 and was one of the first effective chemotherapeutic agents against bacterial infections.  

While highly toxic, it was a groundbreaking treatment at the time, marking the beginning of modern antimicrobial therapy. Later, less toxic arsenic-based compounds like **neosalvarsan** were introduced before penicillin became the primary treatment for syphilis in the 1940s.
15 True ['Jon Batiste'] The New Orleans pianist you're referring to is **Jon Batiste**. In 2021, he won an **Oscar** for Best Original Score for the Pixar film *Soul* (which he co-composed with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). That same year, he released his album **"We Are"**, which later won the **Grammy for Album of the Year** in 2022. 

Despite his success, Batiste continued his role as the bandleader and musical director for *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* until August 2022, when he left to focus on his solo career. 

His deep roots in New Orleans jazz and his genre-blending artistry have made him one of the most celebrated musicians of his generation.
16 True ['Customs'] Upon returning to Earth, the Apollo 11 astronauts had to declare the Moon rocks and other lunar samples to the **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**. 

This was a humorous but formal requirement, as the astronauts filled out a customs declaration form upon landing in Hawaii. The form listed their cargo as "moon rock and moon dust samples," with their departure marked as "the moon" and their arrival from "Honolulu, Hawaii." 

While the declaration was largely symbolic (since the U.S. government owned the samples), it highlighted the bureaucratic procedures that even space missions couldn't escape. The Moon rocks were later transferred to NASA for study and preservation. 

Fun fact: The customs form is now part of the National Archives!
17 True ['O. Henry'] The author of *"The Gift of the Magi"* who was imprisoned for embezzlement in 1898 was **O. Henry** (real name: **William Sydney Porter**). 

While working as a bank teller in Austin, Texas, Porter was accused of embezzling funds from the First National Bank of Austin. He fled to Honduras to avoid trial but returned when his wife became seriously ill. In 1898, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, though he served only about three years at the Ohio Penitentiary. 

It was during his imprisonment that he began writing short stories under the pseudonym **O. Henry**, launching his famous literary career.
18 True ['Byzantine'] The art form you're referring to, characterized by detailed mosaics featuring motifs like the cornucopia (a symbol of abundance), flourished during the **Byzantine era** of the Eastern Roman Empire (circa 400–1400 A.D.). 

### Key Details:
1. **Byzantine Mosaics**:
   - **Timeframe**: Peaked between the 5th and 12th centuries, though the tradition persisted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
   - **Features**: 
     - **Gold Backgrounds**: Used to create a divine, luminous effect (e.g., Hagia Sophia, Ravenna's San Vitale).
     - **Religious and Imperial Themes**: Depicted Christ, the Virgin Mary, saints, and emperors (e.g., Justinian and Theodora mosaics in Ravenna).
     - **Classical Motifs**: The cornucopia, vines, and geometric patterns often appeared in secular or decorative contexts, reflecting Hellenistic and Roman influences.

2. **Cornucopia Symbolism**:
   - Borrowed from ancient Greek and Roman art, it symbolized prosperity and was sometimes adapted into Christian contexts (e.g., in floor mosaics of wealthy homes or churches).

3. **Major Centers**:
   - **Ravenna** (Italy): Home to iconic 6th-century mosaics under Byzantine rule.
   - **Constantinople** (Istanbul): Capital of the empire, though fewer mosaics survive due to iconoclasm and Ottoman conversion of churches.
   - **Thessaloniki** (Greece): Preserved examples like the Hosios Loukas Monastery.

4. **Decline**:
   - Mosaic art waned after the 12th century due to economic constraints and the rise of frescoes, but the tradition influenced later Orthodox Christian art.

This era represents a fusion of early Christian, Roman, and Hellenistic styles, creating a distinct Byzantine aesthetic that emphasized spiritual grandeur and imperial power.
19 True ['Ethiopia'] Hubert Julian, the flamboyant aviator and showman known as the "Black Eagle," went to fight for the **Ethiopian Empire** against Italy during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–1936). 

Julian, an African American pilot, traveled to Ethiopia in 1930 and initially gained favor with Emperor Haile Selassie, even organizing a small air corps. However, his involvement was marred by controversy, including a crash during a demonstration flight. When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Julian returned to support the resistance, though his actual military contributions were limited. 

Ethiopia's defiance against Italian fascism made it a symbol of African resistance, attracting Black international solidarity, including from figures like Julian. Despite Ethiopia's eventual temporary occupation (1936–1941), its earlier victory at Adwa (1896) and this struggle cemented its legacy as a beacon of African independence.
20 True ['Absolution'] The quadrisyllabic word you're looking for is **"absolution."**  

**Absolution** refers to the formal forgiveness of sins granted by a priest in the sacrament of penance (also known as confession or reconciliation). It is pronounced after the penitent confesses their sins and expresses contrition.  

- **Syllables:** ab-so-lu-tion (4 syllables)  
- **Meaning:** The act of absolving or the state of being absolved from sin.  

Would you like any additional details on the sacrament or related terms?
21 True ['Punjab'] Lahore is the capital of the **Punjab** province in Pakistan, which shares a border with India.  

Punjab is Pakistan's most populous province and is culturally and historically significant. The Indian state of Punjab also borders it, making the region a key area in terms of geography, history, and politics between the two countries.
22 False ['Sohpie Dahl'] The model-turned-author actress who is the granddaughter of Patricia Neal is **Tessa Dahl**.  

Tessa Dahl is the daughter of Patricia Neal and Roald Dahl, and she has worked as a model and writer. She has authored several books, including *Working for Love* and *The Dahlmanac*.  

Her daughter, **Sophie Dahl**, is also a well-known model and author, continuing the family's creative legacy.
23 True ['The Goldfinch'] The novel you're referring to is **"The Goldfinch"** by **Donna Tartt**, and its **2019 film adaptation** of the same name.  

In the story, the protagonist, **Theo Decker**, survives a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and, in the chaos, takes **Carel Fabritius's 1654 painting *The Goldfinch***. The theft and its aftermath shape the rest of the novel, exploring themes of loss, art, and fate.  

The film adaptation stars **Ansel Elgort** as Theo, with **Oakes Fegley** as young Theo, and features **Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, and Finn Wolfhard** in key roles.
24 True ['Daniel Defoe'] The 1722 work you're referring to is *Moll Flanders*, written by **Daniel Defoe**. 

The full title of the novel is *The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders*, and it follows the life of its titular protagonist, who navigates a turbulent path through crime, marriage, and social mobility in 18th-century England. Moll Flanders engages in theft, deception, and even bigamy as she strives for financial security and upward mobility. 

Defoe, a prolific writer and journalist, is also known for other works like *Robinson Crusoe* (1719) and *Roxana* (1724). *Moll Flanders* is considered one of the earliest English novels and a significant example of picaresque fiction.
25 False ['Extant'] There are several notable artworks and artifacts that start with "Ex" and have survived over the centuries. Here are a few examples:

1. **Exeter Book** – One of the four major manuscripts of Old English poetry, dating back to the 10th century. It contains famous works like *The Wanderer* and *The Seafarer* and is housed in Exeter Cathedral Library.

2. **Ex Votos** – Small devotional objects offered in gratitude for answered prayers, found in churches and shrines worldwide. Many ancient examples survive from Roman, Greek, and Christian traditions.

3. **Ex Libris (Bookplates)** – Decorative labels indicating ownership of books, some dating back to the 15th century. Collectors preserve early examples as historical artifacts.

4. **Exemplum (Medieval Manuscripts)** – Moralized Bibles and illuminated manuscripts (like the *Bible Moralisée*) contain "exempla" (moral stories) that have survived in libraries and museums.

5. **Exekias’ Vases** – Ancient Greek pottery by the famed 6th-century BCE artist Exekias, such as the *Dionysus Cup* (now in Munich), showcasing black-figure painting.

Would you like details on a specific one?
26 True ['Desperado'] The middle film of Robert Rodriguez' *El Mariachi* trilogy is *Desperado* (1995), which is also the title of a hit song by the Eagles from their 1973 album *Desperado*.  

The trilogy consists of:  
1. *El Mariachi* (1992)  
2. *Desperado* (1995)  
3. *Once Upon a Time in Mexico* (2003)  

The Eagles' song *"Desperado"* is one of their most famous ballads.
27 True ['Siamang'] The obscure 7-letter ape found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia is the **Siamang** (*Symphalangus syndactylus*).  

### Key Details:  
- **Habitat**: Native to the rainforests of Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia) and Indonesia (Sumatra).  
- **Distinctive Features**: The largest species of gibbon, known for its loud, resonant calls due to an inflatable throat sac.  
- **Notable Trait**: Unlike other gibbons, siamangs have webbed fingers (syndactyly) on their feet.  

While "orangutan" is also a rainforest ape from this region, it has 9 letters, making "siamang" the correct answer for a 7-letter obscure ape.  

Let me know if you'd like more details!
28 True ['Abide With Me'] The phrases you're referencing come from the well-known hymn **"Abide with Me"** by Henry Francis Lyte (1847).  

The full line is:  
**"Fast falls the eventide;  
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide."**  

Later in the hymn, the refrain **"In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me"** appears, expressing a plea for God's presence and comfort in all circumstances.  

### Summary of the Meaning:  
- **"Fast falls the eventide"** – The day (or life) is ending quickly, symbolizing approaching darkness (trouble, death, or uncertainty).  
- **"In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me"** – A prayer for God's presence and guidance **through all of life's trials, even in death.**  

The hymn is a deeply comforting plea for divine companionship in times of difficulty and transition. Would you like the full lyrics or a particular verse explained further?
29 True ['Tito'] The 20th-century leader you're referring to is **Tito**—officially **Josip Broz Tito**—the communist revolutionary who led Yugoslavia from its post-WWII founding in 1945 until his death in **1980**. 

Tito ruled under his adopted surname alone, a rarity among global leaders, and his authoritarian yet non-aligned socialist system held Yugoslavia's fractious ethnic groups together through a mix of repression, economic pragmatism, and cult of personality. After his death, the federation's internal tensions resurfaced, culminating in its violent collapse in the **1990s** (a decade he did not witness). His legacy remains polarizing: praised by some for stability and independence from Soviet domination, criticized by others for suppressing dissent and delaying inevitable nationalist conflicts.
30 True ['Don Carlos', 'Don Carlo'] The title character in Giuseppe Verdi's opera *Don Carlo* (also known as *Don Carlos*) is the son of King Philip II of Spain. 

The opera, based on Friedrich Schiller's play *Don Carlos*, tells the story of the conflicted prince Don Carlo, his forbidden love for his stepmother Elisabeth of Valois, and the political and religious tensions at the Spanish court. 

There are several versions of the opera, including the original French *Don Carlos* (1867) and the later Italian *Don Carlo* (1884). The title role is a tenor, and the opera is one of Verdi's grandest and most dramatic works.
31 True ['Humboldt'] The **Garúa** season in the Galapagos is associated with the **Humboldt Current**, a cold ocean current named after the German naturalist and explorer **Alexander von Humboldt**. 

During the Garúa season (roughly June to December), the Humboldt Current brings cold, nutrient-rich waters to the Galapagos, creating cooler temperatures, overcast skies, and misty conditions (hence the name "Garúa," meaning "drizzle" in Spanish). This current also supports the archipelago's rich marine life. 

So, the answer is the **Humboldt Current**.
32 True ['Alphabet City'] The neighborhood in Manhattan's East Village that runs through Avenues A, B, C, and D is **Alphabet City**. 

Alphabet City has historically been a hub for artists, musicians, and counterculture movements due to its relatively affordable (though now gentrified) housing and vibrant creative scene. The name comes from the lettered avenues (A, B, C, and D) east of 1st Avenue, which are the only avenues in Manhattan named after letters rather than numbers. 

Famous artists, musicians, and writers have lived or worked there, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Allen Ginsberg, and the Nuyorican Poets Café founders, among others.
33 False ['The Special Branch'] Sydney Reilly, the infamous spy often associated with the moniker *"Ace of Spies,"* worked as an operative for the **British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)**, commonly known as **MI6** (Military Intelligence, Section 6). 

However, during his time (early 20th century), he was also linked to the **Special Intelligence Service** (a term sometimes used for early foreign intelligence efforts) and collaborated with other British security agencies, including the **Special Branch** of the Metropolitan Police (which handled counter-espionage and political policing at the time). 

If you're looking for a U.K. department with "Special" in its name related to national security, the most likely answer is **Special Branch**, though Reilly's primary affiliation was with MI6 (which did not originally include "Special" in its name). 

For clarity:  
- **MI6 (SIS)** – Foreign intelligence (Reilly's main employer).  
- **Special Branch** – Domestic counter-espionage/political policing (he may have interacted with them).  

Would you like further details on his operations?
34 True ['Nader'] The final official tally from Florida in the 2000 U.S. presidential election was:

- **George W. Bush (R):** 2,912,790 votes  
- **Al Gore (D):** 2,912,253 votes  
- **Ralph Nader (Green Party):** 97,488 votes  

Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate and third-party candidate, received enough votes to potentially sway the extremely close election in Florida, which was ultimately decided by just **537 votes** after recounts and legal battles. Nader's presence in the race was a significant factor in the contentious outcome.
35 True ['Jill Scott'] The actress and singer you're referring to is **Jill Scott**, who starred as **Precious Ramotswe** in the HBO television adaptation of *The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency* series. 

Jill Scott is a Grammy Award-winning R&B/soul singer known for hits like *"A Long Walk"* and *"Golden"*, and she brought the beloved character of Mma Ramotswe to life on screen. The show was set in **Botswana**, just like the books by **Alexander McCall Smith**. 

Would you like details on the books or the TV series?
36 True ['Constantine'] The event you're referring to is associated with **Emperor Constantine the Great**. According to tradition, in 312 A.D., before the **Battle of the Milvian Bridge** against Maxentius, Constantine had a vision (or dream) of a cross (or *chi-rho* symbol) in the sky with the words **"In hoc signo vinces"** ("By this sign, you shall conquer"). 

He then adopted the **Chi-Rho (☧)**, a Christian symbol formed from the first two Greek letters of "Christ," as his military standard (the *Labarum*). After winning the battle, Constantine attributed his victory to the Christian God and later issued the **Edict of Milan (313 A.D.)**, legalizing Christianity in the Roman Empire. 

While some accounts describe the vision as a celestial phenomenon (e.g., Eusebius's *Life of Constantine*), others suggest it was a dream. The exact nature of the event remains debated among historians.
37 True ['Ardern'] In 2023, the 42-year-old Prime Minister of New Zealand who made the surprise announcement that she was leaving the job was **Jacinda Ardern**. 

Ardern announced her resignation on **January 19, 2023**, stating that she no longer had "enough in the tank" to continue in the role. She had served as Prime Minister since **October 2017** and was known for her leadership during crises such as the **Christchurch mosque shootings (2019)**, the **COVID-19 pandemic**, and the **White Island volcanic eruption (2019)**. 

Her deputy, **Chris Hipkins**, succeeded her as Prime Minister on **January 25, 2023**.
38 True ['Fossa'] The carnivore with retractable claws that is **not** terrifying to lemurs in real life (unlike its animated portrayal in *Madagascar*) is the **fossa** (*Cryptoprocta ferox*). 

In the *Madagascar* movies, the fossa are depicted as fierce predators relentlessly hunting lemurs, particularly King Julien and his group. However, in reality:  
- **Fossas are indeed the largest carnivores in Madagascar** and do prey on lemurs, but their hunting is not as exaggerated or constant as shown in the films.  
- Lemurs in the wild have evolved alongside fossas and exhibit natural caution, but they don’t live in constant terror as portrayed.  
- Fossas are elusive, cat-like creatures (though more closely related to mongooses) and are critically endangered due to habitat loss, making them far less of a pervasive threat than in the animated universe.  

So while fossas are predators of lemurs, their real-world behavior is much less dramatic than their *Madagascar* depiction!
39 False ['Ensconced'] The word you're looking for is **"fixed."**  

- **"Fixed"** can mean settled, stable, or not moving (e.g., *"a fixed address"*).  
- It also relates to a **light fixture**, as in *"a fixed light"* (as opposed to a movable lamp).  

So, the answer is:  
### **Fixed**
40 True ['The Power of the Dog'] The 2021 Western film you're referring to is *The Power of the Dog*, directed by Jane Campion. In the movie, anthrax, which was earlier seen affecting cows, becomes a key element in the plot. Benedict Cumberbatch's character, Phil Burbank, later handles contaminated hides, leading to his implied infection and demise. The film is a psychological drama set in 1920s Montana, exploring themes of masculinity, repression, and revenge. 

Would you like any additional details about the film?
41 True ['The Turn of the Screw'] Peter Quint is the ghostly antagonist in Benjamin Britten's opera *The Turn of the Screw*, which is based on the 1898 novella of the same name by **Henry James**. 

The opera, composed in 1954 with a libretto by Myfanwy Piper, closely follows James's chilling Gothic tale about a governess who becomes convinced that the two children in her care are being haunted and corrupted by the ghosts of former servants, Peter Quint and Miss Jessel. The story is renowned for its psychological ambiguity and eerie atmosphere.
42 True ['Night Vale'] Yes! Wil Wheaton voices the character of **Chef Paul** at the fictional restaurant **Tourniquet** in the podcast *Welcome to Night Vale* (not *Welcome to What Strange Town*). *Night Vale* is known for its surreal, darkly humorous storytelling where strange and supernatural events are commonplace. 

Chef Paul appears in **Episode 100: "Toast"** (2017), where he serves unsettling dishes at Tourniquet, a restaurant with a disturbing reputation. Wil Wheaton's performance adds to the eerie, offbeat tone of the show. 

If you're a fan of *Welcome to Night Vale* or Wil Wheaton's voice acting, this is a fun cameo to check out! Let me know if you'd like more details.
43 True ['Chisholm'] The woman who won 152 delegates as a candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1972 before withdrawing from the race was **Shirley Chisholm**. 

Chisholm, a trailblazing congresswoman from New York, was the first Black woman elected to Congress and the first Black woman to seek a major party's presidential nomination. Though her campaign faced significant challenges—including limited funding and institutional support—she earned 152 pledged delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention before ultimately withdrawing and endorsing George McGovern. Her historic run paved the way for future women and minority candidates in U.S. politics.
44 False ['Jacobs Ladder'] The high-voltage traveling arc that is maintained by ionized air and resembles a moving spark is commonly known by the biblical name **"Pillar of Fire."**  

This term originates from the Book of Exodus in the Bible, where God guided the Israelites at night as a pillar of fire (Exodus 13:21-22). The name has been adopted to describe the visual phenomenon of a sustained, mobile plasma discharge created by high-voltage electricity, often seen in devices like Tesla coils or Jacob's ladders.  

Another possible name for such an electrical discharge is **"Jacob's Ladder,"** referring to the climbing arc effect between two diverging electrodes, though this is more specific to a particular setup rather than a general "pillar of fire."  

Would you like more details on the electrical or biblical aspects?
45 True ['The Metro'] The poem you're referring to is **"In a Station of the Metro"** by Ezra Pound.  

The **"M"** poem you're asking about is likely **"The Waste Land"** by T.S. Eliot, which Pound famously edited and helped shape. However, if you're looking for another very short Imagist poem starting with **"M,"** one possibility is **"Morning at the Window"** by Eliot, though it's not as brief as Pound's two-line masterpiece.  

Alternatively, if you're thinking of another ultra-short modernist poem, **"The Red Wheelbarrow"** by William Carlos Williams (though it starts with **"W"**) is often paired with Pound's work in discussions of Imagism.  

If you meant a different **"M"** poem by Pound himself, one example is **"Medallion"** from *Hugh Selwyn Mauberley*.  

Could you clarify if you had a specific **"M"** poem in mind?
46 True ["Harry's House"] The possessive title of the third solo pop music album by **Harry Styles** is **"Harry's House."**  

Released on **May 20, 2022**, it is his third studio album following *Harry Styles* (2017) and *Fine Line* (2019). The album includes hits like **"As It Was"** and **"Late Night Talking."**  

The title reflects a more personal and intimate theme, as Styles described it as a metaphorical "house" representing his thoughts and emotions.
47 True ['Eroica'] Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. Here's the given clue:

**"This name for a Beethoven symphony is what sexy section of the bookstore with one letter removed?"**

### Understanding the Components

First, let's break down the clue into its main parts:

1. **Name for a Beethoven symphony**: Beethoven composed nine symphonies, each commonly referred to by their number (e.g., Symphony No. 5) or sometimes by nicknames (e.g., "Eroica" for Symphony No. 3, "Pastoral" for Symphony No. 6).
   
2. **Sexy section of the bookstore**: Bookstores often have sections categorized by genre. The "sexy" section would likely refer to the "Erotica" section, which contains literature focused on sexual themes.

3. **With one letter removed**: This suggests that if we take the name of a Beethoven symphony and remove one letter from it, we should get the name of the sexy section of the bookstore.

### Identifying the Symphony Nickname

From Beethoven's symphonies, the ones with notable nicknames are:

- Symphony No. 3: "Eroica" (meaning "heroic" in Italian)
- Symphony No. 6: "Pastoral"
- Symphony No. 9: "Choral" (due to the choral finale)

The most prominent nickname is "Eroica" for Symphony No. 3.

### Analyzing "Eroica" and "Erotica"

Now, let's look at "Eroica" and "Erotica":

- "Eroica": E-R-O-I-C-A
- "Erotica": E-R-O-T-I-C-A

Comparing the two:

- Both start with "Ero".
- "Eroica" has an "I" after "Ero", while "Erotica" has a "T".
- Then both have "ica" at the end.

So, to get from "Eroica" to "Erotica", we'd need to:

1. Remove one letter from "Eroica".
2. Add or adjust letters to get "Erotica".

But the clue says "with one letter removed", implying that removing one letter from the symphony's name gives the bookstore section's name.

Let's see:

"Eroica" has 6 letters: E, R, O, I, C, A.

"Erotica" has 7 letters: E, R, O, T, I, C, A.

Wait, "Erotica" is longer than "Eroica", so removing a letter from "Eroica" can't give us "Erotica". This seems contradictory.

Perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the symphony's name isn't "Eroica". Let me think of other nicknames or ways symphonies are referred to.

Another way symphonies are named is by their key, like "Symphony No. 5 in C minor". But that seems too long.

Alternatively, sometimes they're referred to by their number in words, like "Fifth Symphony". But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, is there another nickname? "Choral" for the 9th, but that's short.

Hmm, maybe "Eroica" is the closest, but the letter count doesn't match.

Alternative approach: maybe the bookstore section isn't "Erotica". Are there other "sexy" sections? Maybe "Romance", but that's not as directly "sexy".

Wait, in some bookstores, the "Erotica" section might be labeled as "Adult" or "Adult Fiction". But "Adult" is too short.

Alternatively, "Erotica" is the most likely "sexy" section.

Given that, maybe the symphony name is longer. Beethoven's symphonies are also known by their keys, like "Symphony No. 5 in C minor". But that's too long.

Wait, maybe the nickname is "Eroica Symphony". But that's two words.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a nickname but the formal name. Like "Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major". But that's not helpful.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the symphony is referred to by its number in a different language. For example, in German:

- "Eroica" is still "Eroica".
- "Fifth" is "Fünfte", but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the bookstore section is "Romance", but that's not as directly "sexy".

Wait, let me think about the letters again. If "Erotica" is the bookstore section, and we're removing one letter from the symphony name to get it, then the symphony name must be one letter longer than "Erotica".

"Erotica" is 7 letters. So the symphony name would be 8 letters.

Looking at Beethoven's symphony names:

- "Eroica" is 6 letters.
- "Pastoral" is 8 letters. Hmm.

"Pastoral": P-A-S-T-O-R-A-L (8 letters).

If we remove one letter to get something like "Erotica", let's see:

Remove 'P': "astoral" – no.
Remove 'A': "pstoral" – no.
Remove 'S': "patoral" – no.
Remove 'T': "pasoral" – no.
Remove 'O': "pastral" – no.
Remove 'R': "pastoal" – no.
Remove 'A': "pastorl" – no.
Remove 'L': "pastora" – no.

No, that doesn't work.

Another nickname: "Choral" is for the 9th, but that's short.

Wait, maybe the symphony is referred to by its key. Like "C minor" for the 5th. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the symphony name is "Eroica" and the bookstore section is something like "Erotic", which is "Erotica" without the 'a'. But that's the opposite – adding a letter.

Wait, the clue says "with one letter removed". So from the symphony name, remove one letter to get the bookstore section.

If the bookstore section is "Erotic" (without the 'a'), then the symphony name would be "Erotica" with a letter added. But Beethoven's symphony isn't called "Erotica".

This seems stuck. Maybe the bookstore section isn't "Erotica". Is there another term? "Romance" is too general. "Adult" is too short.

Wait, in some contexts, "Erotica" is also called "Erotic Fiction". But that's longer.

Alternatively, maybe the symphony is "Eroica", and the bookstore section is "Erotic", so remove 'a' from "Eroica" to get "Eroic", which is close to "Erotic". But "Eroic" isn't a bookstore section.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: maybe the symphony is "Eroica", and the bookstore section is "Erotica", and the operation is adding a 't', not removing. But the clue says "with one letter removed".

Wait, unless the symphony name is "Erotica", which it's not.

This seems not to fit. Maybe the bookstore section is "Romance", and the symphony is "Romance" with a letter added. But Beethoven's symphonies aren't called that.

Wait, let me think of other symphony names. Maybe not Beethoven. But the clue specifies Beethoven.

Alternatively, maybe the symphony is "Eroica", and the bookstore section is "Erotica", and the operation is adding a 't', but the clue says "removed". Maybe it's a misdirection, and the answer is that "Eroica" plus a 't' is "Erotica", but that's not removing.

Alternatively, maybe the symphony is "Eroica", and the bookstore section is "Eroic", but that's not a section.

This seems stuck. Maybe the answer is that "Eroica" with 'i' removed is "Eroca", which isn't a word.

Wait, maybe the bookstore section is "Erotica", and the symphony name is "Erotica" with a letter added, like "Erotcia", but that's not a symphony name.

This isn't working. Maybe the initial assumption that the bookstore section is "Erotica" is correct, and the symphony name is "Eroica", but the letter operation doesn't fit.

Alternative approach: maybe the symphony is "Eroica", and the bookstore section is "Erotic", so remove 'a' from "Eroica" to get "Eroic", which is close to "Erotic". Maybe it's a play on words where "Eroic" sounds like "Erotic".

But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the symphony is "Eroica", and the bookstore section is "Erotica", and the answer is that "Eroica" is "Erotica" with 't' removed. But the clue says the symphony name is the bookstore section with one letter removed, not the other way around.

Wait, the phrasing is: "the name for a Beethoven symphony is what sexy section of the bookstore with one letter removed?"

This can be parsed as: the symphony name = (bookstore section) - one letter.

So bookstore section = symphony name + one letter.

Given that, if the symphony name is "Eroica", then adding a letter to get the bookstore section: adding 't' gives "Erotica".

But the clue says the symphony name is the bookstore section minus one letter, so:

symphony name = bookstore section -
48 True ['Yemen'] The correct answer is **"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen."**  

The full title of the 2011 romantic comedy-drama film is **"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen."** It stars Ewan McGregor, Emily Blunt, and Kristin Scott Thomas, and is based on the novel of the same name by Paul Torday.  

Let me know if you'd like more details!
49 True ['Pillars of Hercules', 'Hercules'] Spain's flag features the **Pillars of Hercules**, which are the ancient name for the promontories flanking the Strait of Gibraltar—**Calpe (Rock of Gibraltar)** in Europe and **Abila (Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa)** in North Africa. 

These pillars appear on the Spanish coat of arms, wrapped with a red banner bearing the Latin motto **"PLUS ULTRA"** ("Further Beyond"), symbolizing Spain's historical exploration and expansion beyond the known world. The flag also incorporates emblems representing Spain's historic kingdoms, such as:

- **Castile** (a golden castle)  
- **León** (a purple lion)  
- **Aragon** (four red stripes on gold)  
- **Navarre** (linked gold chains)  
- **Granada** (a pomegranate)  

The Pillars of Hercules tie into Spain's imperial history and its connection to the gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
50 True ['Crohn'] The answer is the **Burrill B. Crohn Foundation** (now known as the **Crohn's & Colitis Foundation**).  

Here’s the breakdown:  
- In 1967, the **Ileitis and Colitis Organization** (a precursor to today’s Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation) held a dance fundraiser featuring Ella Fitzgerald.  
- The event honored **Dr. Burrill B. Crohn**, one of the physicians who first described Crohn’s disease.  
- The organization later incorporated his name into its title, becoming the **National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis**, and eventually the **Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation**.  

So, the foundation’s current name includes **Crohn** in honor of Dr. Burrill B. Crohn.
51 False ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] The answer to your riddle is **"Upturn."**  

1. **Economic Meaning:** An "upturn" refers to a period during which business activity is at a high point, marking recovery or growth in the economy.  
2. **Green Meaning:** If you "up-turn" (reuse or repurpose) goods, you are making a better or more sustainable product, aligning with eco-friendly practices.  

Thus, "upturn" fits both definitions!
52 True ['Lisbon'] King Carlos I of Portugal and his eldest son, Luís Filipe, were assassinated in **Lisbon** on **February 1, 1908**. The attack occurred in the **Praça do Comércio** (Commerce Square) as the royal carriage passed through. The assassins were members of the **Carbonária**, a secret revolutionary society opposed to the monarchy and the authoritarian policies of Prime Minister **João Franco**, whom Carlos I had granted extensive powers.  

The king was killed instantly, and Luís Filipe, the heir apparent, died shortly after. The younger son, **Manuel II**, survived and briefly became king before the monarchy was overthrown in the **5 October 1910 revolution**, leading to the establishment of the **Portuguese First Republic**.
53 True ['Jubjub'] The line *"Beware the Jabberwock, my son"* is from Lewis Carroll's famous nonsense poem *"Jabberwocky,"* which appears in *Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There* (1871). The poem is filled with whimsical, invented creatures and words, including the fearsome Jabberwock.

As for the bird that repeats itself but isn't found in ornithological books, you're likely referring to the **"Jubjub bird,"** another creature mentioned in *"Jabberwocky"* (and also in *The Hunting of the Snark*). Its name is a playful repetition ("Jub-Jub"), fitting the poem's nonsensical style. Since it's a fictional creation of Carroll's imagination, it wouldn't appear in real-world bird guides!

Other repeating birds in Carroll's works include the **"Toucan"** (which repeats its syllables in *"The Mock Turtle's Song"*: "Toucan, they told me, you can"), but the Jubjub is the more iconic answer here. 

Would you like more details on Carroll's invented creatures?
54 True ['Inigo Jones'] The architect you're referring to is **Inigo Jones** (1573–1652). He is often regarded as England's first great classical architect and a key figure in introducing Renaissance architecture to England.  

Jones began work on the **Queen's House** in Greenwich in **1616** for Anne of Denmark, the queen of King James I. The Queen's House is considered England's first truly classical building, inspired by the symmetry, proportion, and elegance of Italian Renaissance architecture, particularly the works of Andrea Palladio.  

Inigo Jones also designed other notable buildings, such as the **Banqueting House** in Whitehall (1619–22), and played a significant role in the development of English Palladianism. His work marked a departure from the earlier Tudor and Jacobean styles, paving the way for neoclassical architecture in Britain.
55 True ['Revolutionary Road'] Richard Yates was referring to his novel *Revolutionary Road*, and his statement suggests that the title symbolizes how the ideals of the American Revolution (the spirit of 1776) had stagnated or "hit a dead end" by the conformist, disillusioned 1950s. 

The novel follows Frank and April Wheeler, a couple trapped in suburban ennui, who once saw themselves as exceptional but ultimately succumb to societal expectations and personal failures. Yates implies that the revolutionary aspirations of independence, self-determination, and individualism—central to 1776—had been hollowed out by mid-20th-century materialism, conformity, and emotional repression. 

Thus, the "revolutionary" spirit of the title is deeply ironic, as the Wheelers' dreams of breaking free from convention end in tragedy, mirroring the broader cultural decline Yates perceived in postwar America.
56 True ['medulla oblongata'] The lowest part of the brainstem is called the **medulla oblongata**.  

(It is a two-word name, as requested.)
57 True ['Kool Herc'] Hip-Hop's 50th anniversary in 2023 celebrates the legendary **August 11, 1973**, party in the Bronx where **DJ Kool Herc** (real name: **Clive Campbell**) pioneered the breakbeat technique that became foundational to hip-hop culture.  

The name **"Kool Herc"** was inspired by **Hercules**, the mythical Greek strongman—a fitting moniker for Clive, who was known for his towering physique and powerful sound system.  

So, the answer is: **Hercules** (which evolved into **"Herc"** in his DJ name).
58 False ['Cuspidor'] Alright, let's tackle this anagram puzzle step by step. The question is:

**"Spittingly, a perfect receptacle is what anagram for: Crisp Duo?"**

### Understanding the Question

First, let's break down the question to understand what's being asked.

1. **"Spittingly"**: This seems like an adverb, possibly meaning "in a spitting manner" or "resembling spitting." But in the context of word puzzles, "spittingly" might be a playful way to hint at something related to "spitting" or "spit."

2. **"a perfect receptacle"**: A receptacle is something that holds or contains other things. A "perfect receptacle" could metaphorically refer to something that ideally contains or holds something else. 

   - In everyday terms, a "perfect receptacle" might be a "cup" (holds liquid), "box" (holds items), "bag" (holds things), etc. 
   - But considering "spittingly," which relates to "spit," a "perfect receptacle" for spit might be a "spittoon" (a container for spit, especially used in the past with chewing tobacco).

3. **"is what anagram for: Crisp Duo?"**: This suggests that the "perfect receptacle" (which we're guessing is "spittoon") is an anagram of "Crisp Duo."

### Verifying "Spittoon" as the Perfect Receptacle

Let's check if "spittoon" fits as a "perfect receptacle" in the context of "spittingly":

- **Spittoon**: A container for spit, especially used in places where people chewed tobacco and needed to spit. So, it's literally a receptacle for spit, making it a "perfect receptacle" in this context.

### Checking if "Spittoon" is an Anagram of "Crisp Duo"

Now, let's see if "spittoon" can be formed by rearranging the letters in "Crisp Duo."

First, let's write down the letters in "Crisp Duo":

- C, R, I, S, P, D, U, O

Now, let's count the letters in "spittoon":

- S, P, I, T, T, O, O, N

Comparing the letters:

- "Crisp Duo" has: C, R, I, S, P, D, U, O
- "Spittoon" has: S, P, I, T, T, O, O, N

Let's see if we can map the letters:

- S: present in both
- P: present in both
- I: present in both
- T: "Crisp Duo" doesn't have a T, but "spittoon" has two Ts. This is a problem.
- O: "Crisp Duo" has one O, "spittoon" has two Os.
- N: "Crisp Duo" doesn't have an N.

Hmm, "spittoon" has Ts and an N which aren't in "Crisp Duo," and it's missing the C, R, D, U from "Crisp Duo." So, "spittoon" isn't an anagram of "Crisp Duo."

### Re-evaluating "Perfect Receptacle"

Since "spittoon" doesn't work, let's think of other "perfect receptacles." Maybe something more general:

- "Cup": Doesn't seem to fit the anagram.
- "Box": Too short.
- "Container": Too long.
- "Vessel": Doesn't fit.
- "Bowl": Doesn't fit.
- "Dustbin": Doesn't fit.
- "Trash can": Too long.
- "Pitcher": Doesn't fit.
- "Jar": Doesn't fit.
- "Can": Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe "spittoon" isn't the right receptacle. Let's think differently. Maybe "perfect receptacle" is hinting at something else. 

In grammar, a "receptacle" can metaphorically refer to a word that "contains" other words or letters. Maybe it's a word that can hold or be formed from other letters.

Alternatively, think about "spittingly" as hinting at "spit" or "spitting." Maybe the receptacle is related to that.

Another thought: "spitting image" is a phrase meaning an exact likeness. Maybe "image" is the receptacle, but that doesn't fit the anagram.

Wait, let's think about the letters in "Crisp Duo" and see what words we can make:

Letters: C, R, I, S, P, D, U, O

Possible words:
- "Cupids" + "or" – but not matching.
- "Produce" – but that's 7 letters (P, R, O, D, U, C, E), but we don't have an E.
- "Produc" – not a word.
- "Cupid" + "ros" – not helpful.
- "Crisp" + "duo" – original words.
- "Spur" + "dico" – no.
- "Scrip" + "duo" – no.
- "Spud" + "rico" – no.
- "Proud" + "sic" – no.
- "Disc" + "pour" – no.
- "Crop" + "sudi" – no.
- "Soup" + "crid" – no.

Hmm, not seeing an obvious word that fits "perfect receptacle."

Wait, maybe "spittingly" is hinting at "spit" as in "spit out," and the receptacle is something that receives what's spit out. Maybe "mouth"? But "mouth" isn't an anagram.

Alternatively, think of "spittingly" as "spitting" + "ly," where "spitting" is the action, and "ly" is a suffix. Maybe focus on "spitting."

"Spitting" is present participle of "spit." Maybe the receptacle is "spitoon," but that's the same as "spittoon," which didn't fit.

Wait, maybe "spittingly" is hinting at "spit" + "tingly," but not sure.

Alternative approach: maybe "perfect receptacle" is a "cup," but "cup" is too short.

Wait, let's count letters: "Crisp Duo" is 8 letters (including space, but spaces usually don't count in anagrams). So we're looking for an 8-letter word (if we ignore the space).

"Spittoon" is 8 letters, but as we saw, letters don't match.

Other 8-letter receptacles:
- "Ashtray" – but that's 7 letters.
- "Garbage" – but not matching.
- "Holder" – too short.
- "Vessel" – too short.
- "Container" – too long.
- "Bin" – too short.
- "Pouch" – too short.
- "Sack" – too short.
- "Basket" – too short.
- "Dustbin" – 7 letters.

Not seeing an 8-letter receptacle that fits.

Wait, maybe "spittingly" is hinting at "spit" as in "saliva," and the receptacle is a "saliva container," but that's too long.

Alternatively, think of "spittingly" as "spitting" + "ly," where "spitting" is the action, and "ly" is like "like." Maybe "spit-like receptacle" – still not helping.

Alternative idea: maybe "perfect receptacle" is a "cistern," but that's not an anagram.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe "spittingly" is a hint to look for a word that sounds like or is related to "spit," and then see if that word is an anagram.

"Spit" related words:
- "Spittle" – but not an anagram.
- "Spout" – no.
- "Drool" – no.
- "Expectorate" – too long.
- "Saliva" – no.

Not helpful.

Alternative approach: maybe "perfect receptacle" is a "cup," and we're to find an anagram of "Crisp Duo" that means "cup." 

Is there a word for "cup" that can be made from "Crisp Duo"? 

Looking at letters: C, R, I, S, P, D, U, O

"cup" is C, U, P – but that's only 3 letters.

"mug" – no M.
"glass" – no L, A.
"tumbler" – too long.
"goblet" – no G, B, E, T.

Not seeing it.

Wait, maybe "spittingly" is hinting at "spitting" as in "dividing," and "perfect receptacle" is something that divides perfectly, like a "split" or "partition," but not matching.

Alternative idea: maybe "spittingly" is hinting at "spitting" as in "spitting out letters," so the anagram is the answer.

Let me try to rearrange "Crisp Duo" to form another word:

"Crisp Duo" – remove space: "crispduo"

Letters: c, r, i, s, p, d, u, o

Possible words:
- "producis" – not
59 True ['Giraffe'] The walk where both legs on the same side move at the same time is called a **"pace."** This gait is commonly seen in certain relatives of the okapi, such as **giraffes** and **camels**, as well as some horse breeds. 

In the pace, the legs on one side (left front and left hind, or right front and right hind) move forward together, creating a distinctive swaying motion. This differs from the amble, which is a smoother, four-beat gait where the legs move in a lateral sequence but not strictly in unison. 

So, the relative of the okapi that often paces is the **giraffe** (both are members of the Giraffidae family).
60 True ['Wesley'] The John who founded Methodism and has an American university named after him is **John Wesley**. The university is **Wesleyan University**, located in Middletown, Connecticut. 

John Wesley, along with his brother Charles Wesley, was a key founder of the Methodist movement. While there are other institutions named after Methodism (such as Emory University, which has Methodist ties but is not directly named after Wesley), Wesleyan University is the most prominent American university explicitly named in his honor. 

Other notable "Johns" with universities named after them include:
- **John Harvard** (Harvard University)
- **John Marshall** (Marshall University)
- **Johns Hopkins** (Johns Hopkins University, though "Johns" was his given name, not a plural). 

But in the context of Methodism, **John Wesley** is the correct answer.
61 True ['Perdition'] In the 2009 film *The Road*, Tom Hanks plays a character who is on the road to **"Perdition,"** meaning spiritual loss or ruin. 

The full title of the film is *Road to Perdition*, and "perdition" is an old-fashioned term for eternal damnation or hell, symbolizing moral corruption and inevitable downfall. Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan, is a hitman whose violent life leads him toward a path of destruction, both for himself and his son. 

So, the answer is: **Perdition**.
62 True ['Muir'] The national monument in Marin County known for its old-growth redwoods is **Muir Woods**, named after the renowned conservationist **John Muir**.  

John Muir was a Scottish-American naturalist, author, and early advocate for wilderness preservation in the United States. He played a key role in the establishment of national parks like Yosemite and Sequoia and co-founded the **Sierra Club**. Muir Woods was designated a national monument in 1908 to protect its ancient coast redwoods (*Sequoia sempervirens*).
63 True ['Jack Aubrey'] The hero from Patrick O'Brian's *Aubrey-Maturin* series who was brought to the big screen by Russell Crowe is **Captain Jack Aubrey**.  

The 2003 film adaptation, titled *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World*, starred Crowe as Aubrey, with Paul Bettany playing his close friend and ship's surgeon, **Dr. Stephen Maturin**. The movie primarily drew from *The Far Side of the World* (the 10th book in the series) but also incorporated elements from other novels in the series.  

While the film was critically acclaimed, no further adaptations were made, despite the rich source material available in O'Brian's 20-book series.
64 True ['bluebonnet'] The Texas trail named for the state flower is the **Bluebonnet Trail**. 

The **bluebonnet** (Lupinus texensis) is the state flower of Texas, and its vibrant blooms are a celebrated sign of spring. Several areas in Texas, particularly around **Ennis** and the **Hill Country**, have designated Bluebonnet Trails where visitors can enjoy scenic drives or walks amid fields of these iconic wildflowers. 

Would you like recommendations for the best spots to see bluebonnets in Texas?
65 True ['Norway'] In 2008, Jens Stoltenberg, the Prime Minister of **Norway**, placed rice as the inaugural deposit in the **Svalbard Global Seed Vault**. 

The seed vault, located on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, is a secure backup facility designed to preserve the world's crop diversity in case of global crises. Norway funded and built the vault, and Stoltenberg's symbolic deposit marked its official opening.
66 True ['Pacific'] The May 18, 1942, *Time* Magazine cover featuring Admiral Chester W. Nimitz with the headline **"Nimitz, Commander – Where: A Big Place to be in Charge of"** referred to his command of the **Pacific Ocean Areas (POA)** during World War II. 

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Nimitz was appointed **Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC)** and later also became **Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA)**, a massive theater spanning thousands of miles from the Aleutians to the South Pacific. The "big place" underscored the enormity of his responsibility—leading Allied forces against Japan across an expanse larger than any other theater of war. 

This cover appeared just months after Nimitz took command and as the U.S. began turning the tide at battles like Coral Sea (May 1942) and Midway (June 1942). The phrasing playfully acknowledged the daunting scale of his role.
67 False ['Third Rock from the Sun'] The TV sitcom you're referring to is likely *Out of This World*, which aired from 1987 to 1991. The show follows the **Solomon family**, particularly **Evie Ethel Garland Solomon**, a teenage girl who discovers that her father is an alien from the planet Anterius.  

Evie has special powers (like stopping time with her fingertips) and often communicates with her alien father through a glowing cube. The show blends family sitcom elements with sci-fi humor.  

Is this the series you were thinking of?
68 True ['Tuvalu'] The former Ellice Islands are now known as **Tuvalu**, a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean. Tuvalu derives a significant portion of its revenue from leasing its **.tv** top-level domain (TLD), which is popular with media and entertainment companies due to its association with television. 

The licensing agreement for the **.tv** domain provides Tuvalu with millions of dollars annually, making it an important source of income for the country alongside remittances and fishing licenses.
69 True ['Trepanning', 'trepanation', 'trephination', 'trephining'] The ancient medical procedure you're referring to is called **trepanation** (or **trephination**). 

Trepanation involves drilling, cutting, or scraping a hole into the skull, and it is one of the oldest known surgical practices, dating back thousands of years (with evidence from Neolithic times). It was performed for various reasons, including:
- Relieving intracranial pressure (e.g., from head injuries or swelling).
- Treating headaches, seizures, or mental disorders.
- Releasing "evil spirits" or demons believed to cause illness (a spiritual/ritualistic explanation in some cultures).

Some prehistoric and ancient skulls show signs of healing, indicating that patients sometimes survived the procedure. While modern neurosurgery still uses a similar technique (craniotomy) for medical purposes, trepanation was historically practiced without the advanced knowledge or tools available today.
70 True ['Templar'] In 1310, **54 Knights Templar** were tried in Paris for heresy and later burned at the stake. This occurred during the suppression of the **Order of the Knights Templar**, which was orchestrated by King **Philip IV of France** (Philip the Fair) in collaboration with Pope **Clement V**.  

The charges against them included heresy, blasphemy, and various other accusations, many of which were likely fabricated or obtained under torture. The mass execution took place near the **Île aux Juifs** (Jews' Island) in the Seine River, where the condemned were burned as relapsed heretics after some recanted their forced confessions.

78 True ['Groundlings'] If you were part of the **"groundlings"** at the Globe Theatre, you paid the lowest amount (typically one penny) to stand in the pit (or "yard") and watch the play. 

The groundlings were the common folk who stood on the ground in the open-air area directly in front of the stage. They were known for their lively, often rowdy participation in the performances, cheering, jeering, and interacting with the actors. Meanwhile, wealthier patrons paid more to sit in the covered galleries with better views and seating. 

The term "groundlings" was even playfully referenced by Shakespeare in *Hamlet* (Act 3, Scene 2), where Hamlet mocks the exaggerated acting style that might appeal to them. 

So, if you were a thrifty Elizabethan theatergoer, the groundlings' pit was the place to be!
79 True ['Austria'] The 1 Euro coin designed by Josef Kaiser was issued by **Austria**.  

Josef Kaiser, an Austrian artist, created the design for the Austrian 1 Euro coin, which features a portrait of **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart**, celebrating the famous composer who was born in Salzburg, Austria.

86 True ['Marlow'] The character you're referring to is **Kurtz** from **Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness***. However, the protagonist who travels up the Congo River and hears about "the horror" while questioning Western civilization is **Charles Marlow**, the novel's narrator.

### Key Points:
- **Marlow** is a steamboat captain who journeys into the Congo (a Belgian colony) to meet **Kurtz**, an ivory trader who has gone mad and become a tyrannical figure among local tribes.
- Kurtz’s dying words—*"The horror! The horror!"*—symbolize the brutality of colonialism and the moral decay of European imperialism.
- The novel critiques Western civilization’s hypocrisy, greed, and racism, exposing the darkness at the heart of colonial exploitation.

*Heart of Darkness* (1899) is a foundational work of modernist literature and heavily influenced later works like *Apocalypse Now* (the film adaptation set in Vietnam). Would you like analysis on specific themes or passages?
87 True ['Gallium'] The mini robot that can shape-shift like the T-1000 from *Terminator 2* was created using **gallium (Ga)**, a soft, silvery metal with a low melting point of about **29.76°C (85.57°F)**.

- The ballet's jazzy score was composed by **Leonard Bernstein** and later expanded into the Broadway musical *On the Town* (1944).  
- The title **ends with "-ree"** ("Fancy Free"), fitting your clue.  

So, the answer is **"Fancy Free"**—Robbins' first major ballet, which inspired *On the Town*.
89 True ['Justinian'] The 6th-century outbreak of the **Bubonic Plague** that ravaged the Byzantine Empire is named after Emperor **Justinian I** (r. 527–565 AD). Known as the **Justinianic Plague**, it first emerged around **541–542 AD** during his reign and caused massive devastation, killing millions across the empire and weakening its economy and military.

Justinian himself contracted the plague but survived, though the outbreak significantly hindered his efforts to restore the Roman Empire's former glory (including his ambitious reconquests in Italy and North Africa). The plague recurred in waves for over two centuries and is now believed to have been caused by the same bacterium (*Yersinia pestis*) responsible for the later **Black Death** (14th century). 

This event is a key factor in the decline of the Byzantine Empire in the early Middle Ages.
90 True ['Pensacola'] In 1559, a Spanish expedition led by Tristán de Luna y Arellano established a settlement near the western end of Florida's Panhandle. This short-lived colony was located in what is today **Pensacola, Florida**. 

The settlement, known as **Santa María de Ochuse**, was intended to be a permanent Spanish outpost but was abandoned in 1561 after hurricanes, supply shortages, and conflicts with local Native American tribes made survival difficult. Pensacola later became the site of more successful Spanish settlements in the late 17th century. 

So, the correct answer is **Pensacola**.
91 True ['Avogadro'] The law you're referring to is **Avogadro's Law**, named after the Italian scientist **Amedeo Avogadro**. 

### **Avogadro's Law (1811)** states:  
> *"Equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules."*  

### **Key Points:**
- **Volume (V) is directly proportional to the number of gas molecules (n)** when temperature (T) and pressure (P) are constant.  
  \[ V \propto n \]  
- This law helped establish the concept of the **mole** and Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules per mole).  
- It was crucial in developing the **ideal gas law**:  
  \[ PV = nRT \]  

Avogadro's work was initially overlooked but later became fundamental in chemistry and physics, especially in understanding molecular theory.  

Would you like a deeper explanation or historical context?
92 True ['Tequila'] The Champs' sax-heavy instrumental hit from 1958 with the only lyric being the title—a reference to booze—is **"Tequila"**.  

Written by Danny Flores (who also played the iconic sax riff under the nickname "Chuck Rio"), the song became a massive No. 1 hit and remains one of the most recognizable instrumentals in rock and roll history. The lone vocal is the shouted word *"Tequila!"* at key moments in the track.  

Fun fact: It won the 1959 Grammy for Best R&B Performance and has been featured in countless films, commercials, and pop culture moments. 🎷🥃
93 True ['August Strindberg'] The Swede with a "monthly name" who wrote *Married* (1884) and was persecuted for blasphemy is **August Strindberg**.  

Strindberg's *Married* (*Giftas*) was controversial for its critique of traditional marriage, religion, and societal norms, leading to charges of blasphemy in Sweden. His name, "August," resembles the month, fitting the "monthly name" clue. He remains one of Scandinavia's most influential literary figures.
94 True ['Freebooter'] The "Free" shoe in a pirate's name is likely referring to the **"Freebooter"**—a term historically used for pirates or privateers.  

The word **"Freebooter"** comes from the Dutch **"vrijbuiter"** (meaning "plunderer" or "one who takes booty freely"), which sounds similar to "free boot." Over time, it evolved into terms like **"filibuster"** (in some contexts) and was associated with pirates who operated outside the law.  

So, if you're thinking of a pirate-related name with "Free" in it, **"Freebooter"** is the most fitting answer! 🏴‍☠️👢
95 True ['Bhutan'] The world's highest unclimbed mountain, **Gangkhar Puensum (24,980 feet / 7,570 meters)**, is located in the **"Thunder Dragon Kingdom"** of **Bhutan**, a Himalayan nation north of India.  

Bhutan banned mountaineering above 6,000 meters in 1994 out of respect for local spiritual beliefs, leaving Gangkhar Puensum unclimbed to this day. Its name translates to **"White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers"** in Dzongkha.  

Fun fact: A 2003 attempt from the Chinese side (where it's called *Kangkar Punsum*) was also unsuccessful due to permit issues, solidifying its status as the tallest unclimbed peak.  

Would you like details on Bhutan's unique cultural or environmental policies related to mountains?

As she delivers the final blow, she recites the iconic lines:  
*"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe…"*  
And with a triumphant *"Off with your head!"* (echoing the Queen of Hearts), she beheads the beast.  

**Callooh! Callay!** indeed—a fittingly whimsical and heroic moment!
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome is credited with completing the **Vulgate** (from the Latin "versio vulgata," meaning "common translation") around 405 AD.

102 True ['Bret Easton Ellis'] The novel *Less Than Zero*, which depicts the lives of wealthy, disaffected youth in 1980s Los Angeles, was written by **Bret Easton Ellis**. Published in 1985, it became a defining work of the Brat Pack literary movement and captured the nihilism and excess of the era. 

The 1990s film adaptation (starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jami Gertz) shifted the timeline slightly but retained the novel's themes of alienation and moral decay. Ellis is also known for *American Psycho* and *The Rules of Attraction*.
103 True ['Kent'] The white cliffs of Dover are located along the coast of **Kent**, which is the southeasternmost county in England.

105 True ['Ha Ha'] Ah, you're thinking of the charming and historically clever **"ha-ha" fence**!  

At Monticello, Thomas Jefferson used a **ha-ha** (or **sunk fence**) to keep grazing animals out of the formal gardens without obstructing the view. The name comes from the surprise reaction ("ha ha!") people had when they suddenly noticed the hidden ditch and wall that kept animals at bay.  

It’s a witty, practical solution—perfect for blending landscape aesthetics with function. Want to make it funnier? Call it the **"Moo-ve Along Wall"** or the **"Sheepish Drop"** for a playful twist! 😄
106 True ['Venerate'] The word you're looking for is **"venerate."**  

- **Origin:** It comes from the Latin *"venerari,"* which means "to worship, revere, or adore," derived from *"Venus"* (the Roman goddess of love and beauty).  
- **Meaning:** To regard with deep respect, devotion, or reverence, often in a religious or spiritual context.  

While **"venerate"** is more about reverence than direct "love," it is closely tied to the Latin roots of devotion. If you were thinking of a word more directly meaning "love," **"venerate"** might still fit the reverence aspect, but another option is:  

- **"Venus"** (the name itself, representing love) or **"venerate"** as the verb form.  

Let me know if you'd like further clarification!
107 True ['Flagella', 'Flagellum', 'Flagellin'] The parts of a bacterial cell that provide motility and are longer than cilia are called **flagella** (singular: flagellum). 

### Key Features of Bacterial Flagella:
1. **Structure**: 
   - Bacterial flagella are long, whip-like appendages composed of the protein **flagellin**.
   - They are much longer than cilia (which are shorter and more numerous, typically found in eukaryotic cells).

2. **Function**:
   - Flagella rotate like propellers to enable bacterial movement (chemotaxis, phototaxis, etc.).
   - They allow bacteria to swim toward nutrients or away from harmful substances.

3. **Arrangement**:
   - **Monotrichous**: Single polar flagellum.
   - **Lophotrichous**: Multiple flagella at one end.
   - **Amphitrichous**: Flagella at both ends.
   - **Peritrichous**: Flagella distributed all over the cell surface.

4. **Mechanism**:
   - Powered by a **proton motive force** (or sodium ions in some species), driving rotation via a motor at the base.

### Contrast with Cilia:
- Cilia are shorter, hair-like structures found in eukaryotes (e.g., human respiratory tract, protozoa) and move in coordinated waves.
- Bacteria do **not** have true cilia; their motility is driven solely by flagella or other mechanisms (e.g., gliding motility in some species).

Thus, **flagella** are the primary motility structures in bacteria that are longer than cilia.
108 True ['Bill Hodges'] "Finders Keepers" is the second book in **The Bill Hodges Trilogy** by Stephen King. The first book in the series is *Mr. Mercedes* (2014), followed by *Finders Keepers* (2015), and concluding with *End of Watch* (2016).

The word ends with **"-y"** (from Greek *hagios* "holy" + *-graphia* "writing") and fits your description perfectly.
119 True ['Potsdam'] The city you're referring to is **Potsdam**. 

Originally a residence of the Electors of Brandenburg and later the Prussian kings, Potsdam was chosen as the site of the **Potsdam Conference** (July–August 1945), where the Allied leaders (Stalin, Truman, and Churchill/Attlee) met to discuss the post-World War II order, including the administration of defeated Germany. 

The conference took place at the **Cecilienhof Palace**, the former residence of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia.
120 True ['Francis Bacon'] The 17th-century essayist and Lord Chancellor of England you're referring to is **Francis Bacon**. 

The 20th-century painter of *Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)* is **Francis Bacon** (1909–1992), known for his emotionally raw and distorted figurative works. 

Thus, both figures share the same first and last name: **Francis Bacon**. 

The 17th-century Bacon was a philosopher, statesman, and pioneer of the scientific method, while the 20th-century Bacon was a renowned expressionist painter. Despite the shared name, they are not directly related.
121 True ['Calypso'] The nymph you're referring to is **Calypso**, who shares her name with the **Calypso music style**. 

In Angelica Kauffmann's painting *"Telemachus and the Nymphs of Calypso"* (1782), Odysseus' son **Telemachus** is welcomed by Calypso and her nymphs during his search for his father. 

Calypso is best known from Homer's *Odyssey* for detaining Odysseus on her island, Ogygia, for seven years. The musical style **calypso** originates from Trinidad and Tobago, but its name is indeed derived from the mythological nymph. 

Kauffmann's neoclassical work captures the moment Telemachus encounters Calypso's entourage, blending mythological storytelling with 18th-century artistic elegance.
122 True ['The Thing'] The movie you're referring to is **"The Thing" (1982)**, directed by John Carpenter.

> *"Sir James Dewar*  
> *Is a better man than you are,*  
> *None of you asses*  
> *Can liquefy gases!"*

### Context:
- **Sir James Dewar (1842–1923)** was a pioneering scientist who, in 1891, succeeded in liquefying hydrogen for the first time. He also made advancements in cryogenics and invented the vacuum flask to store liquefied gases at extremely low temperatures.
- The verse is a lighthearted jab at his contemporaries, implying that none of them ("you asses") could match his ability to liquefy gases like hydrogen or oxygen, which were groundbreaking accomplishments in the late 19th century.

The rhyme is often cited in scientific circles as an example of witty, academic humor. Dewar's work laid the foundation for modern low-temperature physics, though ironically, he never patented the Thermos flask, which became a commercial success for others.
124 True ['Cold Open'] The opening scene you're referring to is called the **"Cold Open."** 

On *Saturday Night Live*, the cold open is a sketch that airs before the show's title sequence and often satirizes current events or politics. The phrase "cold open" fits your clue perfectly—it's two words, each with four letters. 

After the cold open, the show cuts to the iconic *SNL* title sequence with the announcer saying, *"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"*
125 True ['Tom Jones'] The Welch legend who had an unplanned but electrifying duet with Jennifer Hudson on *The Voice U.K.*, performing *It's a Man's Man's Man's World*, is none other than **Sir Tom Jones**!  

The spontaneous moment happened during the 2017 season when Jennifer Hudson (a coach at the time) joined Sir Tom on stage for a powerhouse rendition of the James Brown classic. Their soulful, show-stopping performance went viral, showcasing the incredible vocal chemistry between the two icons.  

Fun fact: Tom Jones is from Pontypridd, Wales, and is one of the most legendary voices to come out of the U.K. His decades-spanning career includes hits like *It's Not Unusual*, *Delilah*, and *Sex Bomb*.  

Would you like a link to the performance? It’s a must-watch!
126 True ['Windward'] The passage you're referring to is the **Windward Passage**.  

- **Location**: The Windward Passage is the strait between the **northwest tip of Haiti (Hispaniola)** and the **southeast coast of Cuba**.  
- **Significance**: It connects the **Atlantic Ocean** to the **Caribbean Sea** and is a key shipping route.  

**Further Southeast**: The **Windward Islands** (part of the Lesser Antilles) share the same name but are located much farther southeast in the Caribbean, forming the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea.  

So, the answer is the **Windward Passage**.
127 True ['Butler'] The female author you're referring to is **Octavia E. Butler**. Her groundbreaking novel **"Kindred"** (1979) follows Dana, a young Black woman from 1970s Los Angeles who is inexplicably pulled back in time to a Maryland plantation in the early 19th century. The story explores themes of slavery, power, survival, and the enduring legacy of racial trauma.  

Butler was a pioneering figure in science fiction and Afrofuturism, and *Kindred* remains one of her most celebrated works. Would you like recommendations for similar books or more on Butler's other works?
128 True ['peristaltic', 'peristalsis'] During pregnancy, heartburn can result from the body slowing down **peristaltic waves**, which are the rhythmic contractions of the digestive tract that help move food through the stomach and intestines. 

This slowdown is partly due to increased levels of **progesterone**, a hormone that relaxes smooth muscles, including those in the digestive system. As a result, food stays in the stomach longer, leading to increased gastric pressure and a higher likelihood of stomach acid refluxing into the esophagus, causing heartburn. 

Additionally, the growing uterus can compress the stomach, further contributing to the problem.
129 True ['The Unbearable Lightness of Being'] The novel you're referring to is *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* (*Nesnesitelná lehkost bytí* in Czech) by Milan Kundera. 

The story revolves around the complex relationships between the main characters: Tereza, who deeply loves Tomas, a womanizing surgeon; and Sabina, Tomas's mistress and a free-spirited artist. The novel explores themes of love, infidelity, political turmoil in Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and 1970s, and philosophical reflections on lightness versus weight in life. 

Would you like any additional details about the book or its themes?
130 True ['endoskeleton'] A 12-letter or longer word for the internal supporting structure of vertebrates is **"endoskeleton."**  

Here are a few longer alternatives if needed:  
- **"axial skeleton"** (13 letters with space, but not a single word)  
- **"vertebral column"** (16 letters with space)  

"Endoskeleton" (11 letters) is the most precise single-word answer, though it falls one letter short. If you strictly need 12+ letters, you might consider **"skeletal system"** (14 letters with space).  

Let me know if you need further clarification!
131 True ['Luminosity'] Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're looking for an astronomical term that is an anagram of "Mutiny Oils" and relates to a star's brightness. 

### Understanding the Components

1. **Anagram**: An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a different word or phrase. Here, we need to rearrange the letters in "Mutiny Oils" to form a meaningful astronomical term.
   
2. **Astronomical Term Related to Star's Brightness**: In astronomy, terms that describe a star's brightness include:
   - Luminosity
   - Magnitude (apparent or absolute)
   - Brightness (though this is more general)
   - Intensity
   - Radiance

Given that we're looking for a term that's an anagram of "Mutiny Oils," let's see which of these terms or others might fit.

### Analyzing "Mutiny Oils"

First, let's list out the letters in "Mutiny Oils" without spaces:

M, U, T, I, N, Y, O, I, L, S

Total letters: 10

Now, let's count the frequency of each letter:
- M: 1
- U: 1
- T: 1
- I: 2
- N: 1
- Y: 1
- O: 1
- L: 1
- S: 1

### Possible Astronomical Terms

Let's brainstorm astronomical terms related to a star's brightness that might be around 10 letters long or can be formed from these letters.

1. **Luminosity**: 
   - Letters: L, U, M, I, N, O, S, I, T, Y
   - Count: L:1, U:1, M:1, I:2, N:1, O:1, S:1, T:1, Y:1
   - This matches exactly with "Mutiny Oils"!

Let's verify:
- "Mutiny Oils" has: M, U, T, I, N, Y, O, I, L, S
- "Luminosity" uses: L, U, M, I, N, O, S, I, T, Y
- All letters are accounted for with the same counts.

2. Checking other terms for completeness:
   - "Magnitude": Too short (8 letters), and doesn't use all letters.
   - "Brightness": Doesn't fit the letter count or letters.
   - "Intensity": Doesn't fit.
   - "Radiance": Doesn't fit.

"Luminosity" seems to be the perfect fit.

### Verifying "Luminosity"

- **Definition**: Luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a star, galaxy, or other astronomical object per unit time. It's a measure of a star's brightness, often considered its intrinsic brightness.
  
- **Anagram Check**:
  - Original: M, U, T, I, N, Y, O, I, L, S
  - Luminosity: L, U, M, I, N, O, S, I, T, Y
  - Same letters, same counts.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing the letters and considering astronomical terms related to a star's brightness, "Luminosity" stands out as the correct anagram for "Mutiny Oils."

**Final Answer**: The astronomical anagram for 'Mutiny Oils' that means a star's brightness is **"Luminosity"**.
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] BRMC is short for **Black Rebel Motorcycle Club**, a rock band that took its name from Marlon Brando's biker gang, the **Black Rebels**, in the 1953 film *The Wild One*.
133 True ['Yellen'] The phrase *"You can bank on giving a high 5"* is a playful hint—**"bank"** suggests a former **Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair**, while **"high 5"** points to the **5th U.S. Vice President** under a president.  

The successor you're referring to is **Paul Volcker**, who served as **Fed Chair (1979–1987)** and later advised President **Barack Obama** (the 44th president, whose VP was **Joe Biden**—the **47th VP**, counting from John Adams). However, the "5th successor" clue is a bit ambiguous—it could also hint at **Janet Yellen** (ex-Fed Chair and current Treasury Secretary) as a successor in economic leadership.  

But the most precise answer is likely **Gerald Ford**—the only U.S. president who was never elected as VP *or* president (he succeeded Nixon after Agnew's resignation, becoming the **5th VP** under the 25th Amendment). However, he wasn’t a Fed chair.  

For a Fed Chair + VP link: **Janet Yellen** (ex-Fed) works loosely, but no ex-Fed chair has been VP. The riddle seems to blend wordplay and history—**Paul Volcker** fits the Fed clue best, even if the "5" is cryptic.  

**Final Answer:** *You can "bank" on high-fiving* **Paul Volcker** *(ex-Fed Chair and key economic figure), though the "5th successor" part may be a stretch!*  

*(If you meant a literal 5th VP successor, that’s tricky—let me know if you’d like alternate interpretations!)*
134 True ['Auricle'] The animals' ears you're referring to are called **auricles**. 

The **auricles of the heart** (also known as atrial appendages) are named for their resemblance to the external ears (auricles) of certain animals, particularly dogs. These small, ear-like pouches extend from the atria (upper chambers) of the heart and help increase blood-holding capacity. 

So, the shared term is **auricle**, derived from the Latin *auricula*, meaning "little ear."
135 True ['Josef K'] The character you're describing is **"K." from Franz Kafka's *The Trial*** (*Der Prozess*).  

### Breakdown of the Clues:  
1. **"Arrested development and legal issues on his 30th birthday"** – *The Trial* begins with Josef K. waking up on his 30th birthday to find himself arrested by an opaque, bureaucratic court system without being told the charges.  
2. **"A letter-perfect life no more at 31"** – Before his arrest, K. was a successful bank official (his name "Josef K." suggests anonymity, but his life was orderly). By the end, his life unravels completely.  
3. **"How Kafka-Esque?"** – The term "Kafkaesque" refers to nightmarish, absurd bureaucracy, which defines *The Trial*.  

### Why It Fits:  
- Kafka’s works often explore themes of alienation, incomprehensible authority, and existential futility—exemplified by K.’s futile struggle against an invisible legal system.  
- The novel was published posthumously (1925) and mirrors Kafka’s own anxieties about power and meaninglessness.  

Other candidates (like *The Metamorphosis*'s Gregor Samsa) don’t match the legal/birthday clues as precisely. *The Trial* is the definitive answer.
136 True ['Animorphs'] The book series you're thinking of is **Animorphs**, written by **K.A. Applegate** in the 1990s.  

The story follows a group of teenagers who gain the ability to **"morph"** into any animal they touch, using this power to fight a secret alien invasion by the parasitic **Yeerks**. The series was known for its mix of sci-fi action, moral dilemmas, and surprisingly dark themes for a middle-grade audience.  

Key details:  
- **Main Characters**: Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, Marco, and later Ax (an Andalite ally).  
- **Enemies**: The Yeerks (slug-like aliens that take over human hosts) and their leader, Visser Three.  
- **Gimmick**: The covers featured holographic images of the kids mid-transformation into animals.  

The series ran for **54 main books** (1996–2001), plus spin-offs like *Chronicles* and *Megamorphs*. It gained a cult following and even had a short-lived **TV adaptation** (1998–1999).  

Would you like recommendations for similar series or more details on *Animorphs*?
137 True ['St. Lawrence Seaway'] The **Welland Canal** is a key component of the **St. Lawrence Seaway**, a 2,300-mile-long (3,700 km) navigation route that connects the **Atlantic Ocean** to the **Great Lakes**. 

Here’s how it fits in:
- The **Welland Canal** bypasses **Niagara Falls**, allowing ships to travel between **Lake Erie** and **Lake Ontario**.
- The **St. Lawrence Seaway** system includes the **St. Lawrence River**, locks, and canals that enable deep-draft vessels to navigate from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to **Lake Superior**.

So, the full route runs from the **Gulf of St. Lawrence** through the **Great Lakes**, with the Welland Canal playing a crucial role in bypassing Niagara Falls.
138 True ['Richard Powers'] *The Overstory* is a novel by **Richard Powers** that weaves together multiple storylines, including one set during the **Pacific Northwest timber wars** of the late 20th century. The book, which won the **Pulitzer Prize for Fiction** in 2019, explores themes of environmental activism, the interconnectedness of life, and humanity's relationship with trees.  

The timber wars storyline involves characters protesting old-growth forest logging, drawing inspiration from real-life conflicts like the **spotted owl controversy** and the activism of groups such as **Earth First!**. If you're interested in eco-fiction or environmental literature, this is a must-read!  

Would you like recommendations for similar books?
139 True ['midships'] The plural-sounding word you're looking for is **"midships"** (or sometimes written as **"midship"**), which refers to the central area of a ship. During naval battles, this area was often a focal point of fierce fighting because it housed critical components like the main mast, helm, and sometimes officers' quarters.  

However, if you're thinking of a term that specifically emphasizes battle, you might be recalling **"mid-deck"** or **"waist"** (the narrow central part of older ships), but **"midships"** is the most general term for the center of a vessel.  

Let me know if you were thinking of a different word!
140 True ['Maximilian'] Mary of Burgundy received a diamond ring inscribed with the letter **"M"** from **Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg**. 

The initial **"M"** stood for both **Mary** and **Maximilian**, symbolizing their union. This gift was part of their betrothal in 1477, which led to their marriage in 1477–78, forming a crucial alliance between the Burgundian and Habsburg dynasties. 

Maximilian later became Holy Roman Emperor (1493–1519), and their marriage laid the foundation for Habsburg dominance in Europe. The ring is often cited as an early example of personalized romantic jewelry.
141 True ['Formosa'] In the 18th century, Taiwan was referred to as **"Formosa"** by European explorers and traders, a name derived from the Portuguese *"Ilha Formosa"* ("Beautiful Island"). 

George Psalmanazar, a notorious impostor, claimed to be a native of Formosa (Taiwan) while fabricating elaborate stories about the island's customs, language, and even its (fictional) practices like human sacrifice. Despite his fraud, his tales captivated London society at the time. 

So, the answer to your question is: **Formosa**.
142 True ["Li'l Abner"] Al Capp created the iconic comic strip **"Li'l Abner"**, which was set in the fictional backwoods town of **Dogpatch, USA**. The strip ran from 1934 to 1977 and followed the humorous adventures of Li'l Abner Yokum, his family, and the eccentric residents of Dogpatch. 

The comic was known for its satire, social commentary, and memorable characters like Mammy and Pappy Yokum, Daisy Mae, and the fearsome **Sadie Hawkins Day** race, which became a cultural phenomenon. 

Would you like more details on any particular aspect of the strip?
143 True ['Uzbekistan'] The 7 countries whose names end with "stan" are:

1. Afghanistan
2. Kazakhstan
3. Kyrgyzstan
4. Pakistan
5. Tajikistan
6. Turkmenistan
7. Uzbekistan

To determine which is alphabetically last, let's list them in order:

1. Afghanistan  
2. Kazakhstan  
3. Kyrgyzstan  
4. Pakistan  
5. Tajikistan  
6. Turkmenistan  
7. Uzbekistan  

The last one alphabetically is **Uzbekistan**.
144 True ['Worsted'] The word you're looking for is **"worsted."**  

- **Starts with 'W'**: Yes.  
- **Sounds bad**: Some might associate it with "worst" (as in the superlative of "bad"), but it's unrelated.  
- **Fabric type**: Worsted is a high-quality wool fabric made from tightly twisted, compacted yarn. It’s smooth, durable, and commonly used for suits, trousers, and pleated skirts due to its fine finish and drape.  

So, despite the misleading sound, "worsted" is actually a premium fabric!
145 True ['Boole'] The English mathematician you're referring to, born in 1815, is **George Boole**. He made foundational contributions to **algebra (Boolean algebra)**, **logic (Boolean logic)**, and indirectly influenced **search algorithms** (via Boolean operators like AND, OR, NOT). His work underpins modern computer science and digital circuit design. 

While "search" and "operators" aren't directly named after him, the Boolean operators used in search engines and programming trace back to his logical system. 

Fun fact: The *Boolean data type* (true/false) in programming honors him!
146 True ['Siegfried'] Around 1850, Richard Wagner began writing a poem titled *The Death of Siegfried* (*Siegfrieds Tod*), which later became the foundation for *Götterdämmerung* (*Twilight of the Gods*), the final opera in his *Ring* cycle (*Der Ring des Nibelungen*). 

Siegfried is the central heroic figure in the *Ring*, a fearless warrior who slays the dragon Fafner, wins the cursed ring, and ultimately meets a tragic fate due to betrayal. Wagner later expanded the cycle backward, adding *Siegfried*, *Die Walküre*, and *Das Rheingold*, but *Siegfrieds Tod* was the initial conception.
147 False ['Tyrion Lannister'] The quote **"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot boy king"** was spoken by **Tywin Lannister** in *Game of Thrones* (Season 3, Episode 4, *"And Now His Watch Is Ended"*). 

He was referring to **King Joffrey Baratheon**, whose cruel and foolish behavior made him a dangerous and ineffective ruler. The line was delivered by **Charles Dance**, who played Tywin, in a private conversation with his daughter **Cersei Lannister**. 

Would you like the full context of the scene?
148 True ['Havel'] The play *Leaving* (2008) is a tragicomedy written by **Václav Havel**, the renowned Czech playwright, dissident, and former president of the Czech Republic. It was his first play in over 20 years, drawing inspiration from his experiences in politics and power after serving as president (1989–2003). The work explores themes of transition, identity, and the absurdity of political life, blending humor with existential reflection—a hallmark of Havel's style.
149 True ['Ghent'] The Treaty of **Ghent**, signed on December 24, 1814, ended the **War of 1812** between the United States and the United Kingdom. The treaty was negotiated in the city of **Ghent**, Belgium, and restored pre-war borders without any significant territorial gains for either side. The conflict essentially ended in a stalemate, though the treaty helped ease tensions and paved the way for improved U.S.-British relations.
150 True ['Parliament Hill'] John Diefenbaker and Lester B. Pearson, both former Prime Ministers of Canada, are commemorated with statues on **Parliament Hill** in **Ottawa**.  

The statues are part of the **"Statues of the Fathers of Confederation"** and other prominent Canadian figures located on the grounds of Parliament Hill, which is the political and ceremonial heart of Canada. Diefenbaker (Canada's 13th PM) and Pearson (Canada's 14th PM and Nobel Peace Prize winner) are honored alongside other key historical leaders.  

Would you like details on their specific statue locations or other figures commemorated there?
151 True ['Electroconvulsive therapy'] ECT stands for **Electroconvulsive Therapy**, a brain stimulation therapy primarily used to treat severe depression, bipolar disorder, and some other mental health conditions when other treatments have been ineffective. 

During ECT, a controlled electrical current is passed through the brain to intentionally trigger a brief seizure, which can lead to changes in brain chemistry that help alleviate symptoms. Modern ECT is performed under anesthesia and muscle relaxants to ensure safety and minimize discomfort. 

While highly effective for certain cases, it is typically reserved for severe or treatment-resistant conditions due to potential side effects, such as memory loss.
152 True ['Dominican'] The Order known as the **Black Friars** is the **Dominican Order**, officially called the **Order of Preachers (O.P.)**. 

The name "Black Friars" comes from the black *cappa* (cloak) they wear over their white habits, which distinguishes them from other religious orders like the Franciscans (Grey Friars) or the Carmelites (White Friars). The Dominicans were founded by **Saint Dominic** in the early 13th century and became prominent for their work in preaching, education, and combating heresy. 

Their black cloaks also symbolize penance and humility, fitting their mission of scholarly preaching and pastoral care.
153 True ['Will and Grace', 'Will & Grace'] The TV sitcom you're referring to is **"Will & Grace"**. 

- **Original Run:** 1998–2006  
- **Reboot:** 2017–2020  
- **Emmy Success:** The show won **16 Primetime Emmy Awards** during its original run, including Outstanding Comedy Series (2000). The reboot added **4 more Emmys**, bringing its total to **20 wins** (with over **90 nominations**).  

Known for its groundbreaking LGBTQ+ representation and sharp humor, *Will & Grace* remains one of the most awarded sitcoms in Emmy history.
154 True ['Axolotl'] The salamander you're referring to is the **Axolotl** (*Ambystoma mexicanum*).  

Its name comes from the Nahuatl words:  
- **"Atl"** (water)  
- **"Xolotl"** (monster or deity, associated with the Aztec god of fire and lightning).  

Thus, **Axolotl** translates to **"Water Monster"** or **"Water God."**  

This fascinating amphibian is native to the lake complex of Xochimilco near Mexico City and is famous for its neotenic traits (retaining larval features like external gills into adulthood). Sadly, it is critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and pollution.  

Would you like details on its biology or cultural significance?
155 True ['Sentience'] Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. I'll break it down to understand what's being asked and how to approach it.

### Understanding the Puzzle

The puzzle states:
> "Take a prison term decided by a judge, insert one letter and you have what book by Nicholas Humphrey about what it is to be conscious?"

This is a word puzzle where we need to:
1. Identify a term that means "a prison term decided by a judge."
2. Insert one letter into this term to form the title of a book by Nicholas Humphrey.
3. The book is about the nature of consciousness.

### Step 1: Identifying "a prison term decided by a judge"

First, let's think of words or phrases that mean a prison term decided by a judge. Common terms include:
- Sentence
- Jail term
- Prison sentence
- Term of imprisonment

The most straightforward term here is "sentence." A judge gives a sentence to a convicted person, which can include prison time.

### Step 2: Inserting one letter into "sentence"

Now, we take the word "sentence" and insert one letter to form a new word that is the title of a book by Nicholas Humphrey about consciousness.

Let's try inserting different letters into "sentence":

- Adding 'a': "sentence" + 'a' – where to insert 'a'?
  - "asentence" – doesn't seem meaningful.
  - "saentence" – no.
  - "seantence" – no.
  - "senatence" – no.
  - "sentenance" – "sentenance" isn't a known word.
  
- Adding 'c':
  - "csentence" – no.
  - "scentence" – no.
  - "secntence" – no.
  - "scentence" – "scent" + "ence" – not meaningful.
  
- Adding 'd':
  - "dsentence" – no.
  - "sdentence" – no.
  - "sedntence" – no.
  - "sdetnence" – no.
  - "sentdence" – no.
  
- Adding 'h':
  - "hsentence" – no.
  - "shentence" – no.
  - "sehntence" – no.
  - "senhtence" – no.
  - "senthcence" – no.
  
Wait, let's try adding 'h' after 's':
  - "s" + "h" + "entence" = "shentence" – not right.
  
Adding 'h' after 'e':
  - "se" + "h" + "ntence" = "sehntence" – no.
  
Adding 'h' after 'n':
  - "sen" + "h" + "tence" = "senhtence" – no.
  
Adding 'h' after 't':
  - "sent" + "h" + "ence" = "senthence" – not a word.
  
Hmm, maybe not 'h'.

- Adding 'i':
  - "isentence" – no.
  - "sientence" – no.
  - "sein tence" – no.
  - "senitence" – no.
  - "sentience" – wait, "sentience"!

"Sentience" is a word meaning the capacity to have feelings or consciousness. That seems relevant to the book's topic about what it is to be conscious.

Let me check:
- Original word: "sentence"
- Insert 'i' after 't': "sent" + "i" + "ence" = "sentience"

Yes, that works!

### Step 3: Verifying the Book

Now, does Nicholas Humphrey have a book titled "Sentience" about consciousness?

Upon checking, Nicholas Humphrey is a psychologist known for his work on consciousness. He has indeed written a book titled "Sentience: The Invention of Consciousness," which explores the nature of consciousness.

### Conclusion

Putting it all together:
- Prison term decided by a judge: "sentence"
- Insert one letter 'i' into "sentence" to get "sentience"
- "Sentience" is a book by Nicholas Humphrey about consciousness.

### Final Answer

The book is **"Sentience"**. 

Here's how:
- Start with "sentence" (a prison term decided by a judge).
- Insert the letter "i" to form "sentience."
- "Sentience" is a book by Nicholas Humphrey about the nature of consciousness.
156 True ['William Jennings Bryan'] The slogan **"Let the people rule"** was famously used by **William Jennings Bryan** during his presidential campaigns. Bryan, a prominent Democrat and populist leader, ran for president in **1896, 1900, and 1908**, advocating for progressive reforms such as free silver, antitrust measures, and greater democracy in government. 

The phrase encapsulated his belief in direct democracy, opposition to elite control, and support for policies that empowered ordinary citizens. Though he never won the presidency, Bryan remained a key figure in the Democratic Party and later served as Woodrow Wilson’s Secretary of State. 

Would you like more details on his campaigns or policies?
157 True ['Knowledge is Power'] The Latin phrase *"Ipsa Scientia Potestas Est"*, written by Sir Francis Bacon, is most commonly translated to the English phrase:  

**"Knowledge itself is power."**  

This famous aphorism appears in Bacon's *Meditationes Sacrae* (1597) and later works, emphasizing the empowering nature of knowledge and learning. A more literal translation could be *"Knowledge itself is power,"* though it is sometimes paraphrased as *"Knowledge is power."*  

Bacon, a key figure in the scientific revolution, championed the idea that understanding nature through empirical study grants humans control over their environment—a foundational principle of modern science.
158 True ['Suva'] The capital of Fiji with **4 letters** that is home to the **University of the South Pacific** is **Suva**.  

- **Suva** is the capital and largest city of Fiji.  
- The **University of the South Pacific (USP)** has its main campus in Suva.  
- The name fits the 4-letter requirement.  

(Note: Some might think of **Nadi**, another Fijian city, but it has 4 letters and is not the capital. The correct answer is **Suva**.)
159 True ['Monsanto'] The company that first developed **Roundup** (glyphosate-based herbicide) and also created the first genetically modified **herbicide-resistant crops** (specifically Roundup Ready crops) is **Monsanto**. 

Monsanto introduced **Roundup Ready soybeans** in 1996, followed by other crops like corn, cotton, and canola. These genetically modified organisms (GMOs) were engineered to survive applications of Roundup, allowing farmers to control weeds without harming the crops. 

**Note:** Monsanto was acquired by **Bayer** in 2018, but the original development of both Roundup and Roundup Ready crops occurred under Monsanto.
160 True ['Rothaniel'] In his 2022 stand-up special, Jerrod Carmichael revealed deeply personal secrets, including his sexuality. The title of the special—and the first name he referenced—was **"Rothaniel."** This was his actual first name, which he had kept private for much of his life. The special was widely praised for its raw honesty and vulnerability.
161 True ['Kyushu'] The sacred island of **Okinoshima** is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located off the coast of **Kyushu**, which is one of Japan's southernmost main islands. 

Okinoshima is part of the **Munakata region** in Fukuoka Prefecture and is associated with the **Munakata Taisha** shrine. The island is renowned for its ancient rituals and strict access restrictions, particularly for women. 

Kyushu is the third-largest of Japan's four main islands (Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku) and is the southernmost of the major islands, excluding the smaller Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa).
162 True ['Rimsky-Korsakov'] The fifth member of **"The Five"** (also known as **"The Mighty Handful"**), the group of Russian composers based in **St. Petersburg**, was **Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov**.  

So, the complete list of **"The Five"** is:  
1. **César Cui**  
2. **Mily Balakirev** (the leader)  
3. **Alexander Borodin**  
4. **Modest Mussorgsky**  
5. **Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov**  

These composers were known for their nationalist approach to Russian classical music, in contrast to the more Western-influenced style of **Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky**, who was associated with **Moscow**.
163 True ['Ming'] The Chinese dynasty that ruled from 1368 to 1644 and imported blue pigment (cobalt) from Prussia for its porcelain was the **Ming Dynasty**.  

During the Ming era, particularly in the early 15th century under the Yongle and Xuande emperors, Chinese porcelain makers began using high-quality cobalt blue pigment imported from Persia (and later from regions like Prussia) to produce the famous **blue-and-white porcelain**. This pigment, known as **"Mohammedan blue" (回青, *hui qing*)**, was prized for its vibrant color and was a key material in Jingdezhen kilns' finest wares.  

By the late Ming period, sources of cobalt expanded, including imports from Central Asia and possibly Europe (via trade networks), contributing to the distinctive blue hues seen in Ming porcelain. The Prussian connection likely refers to later trade interactions, as European cobalt became more prominent in the subsequent **Qing Dynasty (1644–1912)**.  

Would you like details on specific Ming porcelain styles or trade routes for the pigment?
164 True ['Leguizamo'] The Latino actor you're referring to is **John Leguizamo**!  

- He starred in *Summer of Sam* (1999) as Vinny.  
- He played the Violator in *Spawn* (1997).  
- And yes, he voiced **Bruno** in *Encanto* (2021)—but as the song says, *"We don't talk about Bruno!"*  

Leguizamo is a versatile actor known for his work in film, TV, and theater, often bringing humor and intensity to his roles. Great catch!
165 True ['Thorazine', 'Chlorpromazine'] In *Shutter Island* (set in 1954), Dr. John Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) expresses hope for **chlorpromazine** (brand name Thorazine), which was the first antipsychotic drug approved by the FDA that year. 

Chlorpromazine revolutionized psychiatric treatment by offering a pharmacological approach to managing psychosis, particularly schizophrenia. In the film, Dr. Cawley advocates for its use as part of progressive psychiatric methods, contrasting with the more extreme lobotomy procedures still prevalent at the time.
166 True ['Jungian'] The concept of the **anima** (the feminine inner personality in men) is central to **Jungian analysis**, named after the famous psychologist **Carl Gustav Jung**. 

Jung introduced the idea of the anima (as well as the animus, its masculine counterpart in women) as part of his theory of the **collective unconscious** and **archetypes**. His analytical psychology explores how these unconscious elements influence personality, dreams, and individuation (the process of psychological integration and self-realization). 

So, the answer is **Jungian analysis**.
167 True ['Giorgione'] The Venetian Renaissance painter you're referring to is **Giorgione**, whose name means "Big George" in Italian (derived from "Giorgio" and the augmentative suffix "-one"). 

Giorgione was a prominent figure in the Venetian school of painting and is known for his poetic and atmospheric works, such as *The Tempest* and *Sleeping Venus*. His career was brief but highly influential, bridging the styles of his teacher Giovanni Bellini and his pupil Titian. 

Let me know if you'd like more details!
168 True ['Wisconsin'] The prehistoric art in Samuel's Cave, located in **La Crosse County, Wisconsin**, has suffered significant damage due to vandalism. The cave contains rare Native American petroglyphs and pictographs, but unfortunately, many have been defaced or destroyed over the years. Efforts have been made to document and preserve what remains of this important archaeological site.  

Would you like more details on the cave's history or preservation efforts?
169 True ['Highly Effective People'] The three words that complete the title of Stephen R. Covey's book are **"Highly Effective People."**  

So, the full title is:  
**"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."**  

And as a bonus, one of those three words is **"Effective"**—so there you go! 😊  

Would you like a quick summary of the 7 habits?
170 True ['linear accelerator'] The 2-mile-long linac in Menlo Park, CA is short for **linear accelerator (LINAC)**. It was the centerpiece of the **Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)**, a U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory operated by Stanford University. 

This massive linear accelerator was used to accelerate electrons to near light-speed, colliding them with targets or other particles to study the fundamental structure of matter. SLAC played a key role in discoveries like **quarks** (confirming the existence of charm quarks) and contributed to the development of **particle physics** and **X-ray laser technology**. 

In later years, parts of the original linac were repurposed for projects like the **Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS)**, a powerful X-ray free-electron laser. 

Would you like details on specific experiments or discoveries made there?
171 True ['Criminal Minds'] Mr. Scratch is a villain who first appeared in **Season 10** of the CBS series **"Criminal Minds,"** which is set at the **Behavioral Analysis Unit (B.A.U.)**.  

He is a highly intelligent and manipulative cybercriminal known for his ability to induce hallucinations and psychological torment in his victims. His debut episode is titled **"A Thousand Suns" (Season 10, Episode 21)**.
172 True ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] The English equivalent of the Italian proverb **"A caval donato non si guarda in bocca"** is:  

### **"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."**  

This means that when you receive a gift, you shouldn't criticize or question its value—just be grateful for it.  

And calling someone **"you ungrateful thing"** would be a playful (or scolding) way to remind them of this wisdom! 😉
173 True ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 12-letter group referred to in the 1926 Balfour Report is the **"Commonwealth"**. 

The report declared that the United Kingdom and its dominions (e.g., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) were **"equal in status, in no way subordinate to one another"** and united by allegiance to the British Crown. This laid the foundation for the modern **Commonwealth of Nations**. 

(12 letters: **C-O-M-M-O-N-W-E-A-L-T-H**)
174 True ['William Blake'] The visionary English artist and poet you're referring to is **William Blake**. *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* (1790) is one of his most famous illuminated books, blending poetry, prose, and striking illustrations. Blake created both the text and the artwork, embodying his unique mystical and revolutionary philosophy. 

The work challenges conventional moral dichotomies, presenting a dynamic interplay between opposing forces—reason and energy, heaven and hell—as necessary for human creativity and spiritual growth. 

Would you like insights into a particular plate or passage from the book?
175 True ['Han'] The world's largest bridge fountain, **Seoul's Moonlight Rainbow Fountain** (also known as the **Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain**), shoots water that is recycled from the **Han River (Hangang)** below. 

The fountain is installed on the **Banpo Bridge**, which spans the Han River, and it uses water pumped directly from the river, which is then treated and recirculated for the fountain's displays. The Han River is a major waterway in Seoul, and this eco-friendly design helps conserve water while creating a stunning visual attraction.
176 True ['Finnish'] The language you're referring to with the double vowels distinguishing words like **tuli** (fire) and **tuuli** (wind) is **Finnish**!  

Finnish uses vowel length distinctively—single vowels are short, while double vowels (like *uu*, *aa*, *ii*) are long. This changes both pronunciation and meaning. Other examples:  
- **kuka** (who) vs. **kukka** (flower)  
- **mato** (worm) vs. **matto** (carpet)  

This feature is also present in other Uralic languages like **Estonian** and some dialects of **Sami**, but Finnish is the most widely spoken example.  

Would you like help with pronunciation or more examples? 😊
177 True ['Prometheus'] Alright, let's tackle this riddle step by step. I'll break it down to understand what it's referring to.

### Understanding the Riddle

The riddle goes:
"It was lit when which titan hung with mankind but it got real dark after Zeus cuffed him to that mountain?"

Let's parse this sentence:

1. **"It was lit when which titan hung with mankind"**: This suggests that there was a time when a certain titan was associated with mankind, and during that time, "it" was lit.
   
2. **"but it got real dark after Zeus cuffed him to that mountain"**: After Zeus punished this titan by chaining him to a mountain, "it" became dark.

So, the question is asking: What is "it" that was lit when a certain titan was with mankind, but became dark after that titan was punished by Zeus?

### Identifying the Titan

First, let's identify the titan in question. The clues are:
- A titan who "hung with mankind."
- Zeus punished him by cuffing (chaining) him to a mountain.

In Greek mythology, the titan **Prometheus** fits this description:
- Prometheus is known for his association with mankind; he famously gave fire to humans.
- As punishment for this act (and for tricking Zeus), Zeus had Prometheus chained to a mountain (often identified as Mount Caucasus), where an eagle would eat his liver daily, which would regenerate each night.

So, the titan is Prometheus.

### Connecting Prometheus to "It"

Now, what is "it" that was lit when Prometheus was with mankind but got dark after he was chained?

Given Prometheus's most famous act was giving fire to humans:
- Before he gave fire, humans didn't have fire (it was dark).
- After he gave fire, humans had fire (it was lit).
- When Zeus punished him by chaining him, he took away or limited his ability to provide fire, making it dark again.

But the phrasing is a bit tricky: "it was lit when [Prometheus] hung with mankind" implies that when Prometheus was with mankind, "it" was lit. Then after he was chained, "it" got dark.

This seems a bit reversed from the usual story where giving fire made things lit, and taking it away made things dark. Maybe "it" refers to something else.

Alternative interpretation: "hung with mankind" could mean that Prometheus was associated with humans, and during that time, "it" was lit. Then after his punishment, "it" got dark.

What is "it"? 

Possible meanings of "lit":
- Literally illuminated (fire, light).
- Slang for exciting or good ("that party was lit").

Given the mythological context, probably literal light or fire.

So, "it" could be:
- The fire that humans had.
- The torch or flame that Prometheus carried.
- The state of human civilization (with fire = lit, without = dark).

But the phrasing is "it was lit when [Prometheus] hung with mankind," suggesting that the presence of Prometheus made "it" lit.

Perhaps "it" is the torch or the flame that Prometheus brought from the gods to humans. When he was with mankind, the flame was lit (he had given it to them). After he was chained, the flame was taken away or extinguished, making it dark.

But in the myth, fire wasn't taken away after Prometheus was punished; humans kept the fire. So this might not fit.

Alternative idea: Maybe "it" is the sky or the heavens. But not sure how that connects.

Another angle: "lit" could refer to enlightenment or knowledge. Prometheus brought knowledge (fire symbolizes knowledge) to humans. When he was with them, they were enlightened ("lit"), after his punishment, they were in darkness (ignorance). But the myth doesn't say humans lost knowledge after Prometheus was punished.

Wait, maybe "it" is Prometheus himself. Was Prometheus "lit" in some sense?

"Lit" can mean drunk, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, "lit" as in on fire. Was Prometheus on fire? In some versions, Prometheus is associated with carrying fire, but not being on fire himself.

Hmm.

Alternative titan: Maybe not Prometheus. Is there another titan chained by Zeus?

Atlas was punished to hold up the sky, not chained to a mountain.

Other titans: Cronus was imprisoned in Tartarus.

Prometheus seems the best fit.

Maybe "it" is the forge or the fire of the gods. Prometheus was a craftsman, associated with fire. When he was free, the forge was lit; after punishment, it was dark.

Not sure.

Alternative approach: Think of "lit" and "dark" as metaphors. Maybe "it" is the relationship between gods and humans. When Prometheus was helping humans, it was good ("lit"), after punishment, it was bad ("dark").

But the riddle seems to want a concrete "it."

Wait—what if "it" is the torch or the flame that Prometheus used to bring fire to humans. He stole fire from the gods (perhaps carried it in a torch). When he was bringing it to humans, the torch was lit. After he was caught and chained, the torch was extinguished ("dark").

But humans still had fire, so not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "it" is the sun. But the sun isn't directly connected to Prometheus.

Wait—another titan: Helios is the sun god, but not a titan punished by Zeus.

Hmm.

Maybe the phrasing is tricky. "It was lit when which titan hung with mankind" could mean that the titan was the one who was "lit" when he hung with mankind.

So, Prometheus was "lit" (had fire) when he was with mankind, then after punishment, he was in darkness.

But "it" seems to refer to something else.

Perhaps "it" is the state of the world: the world was lit (had light/fire) when Prometheus was with mankind, then dark after his punishment.

But humans kept the fire, so the world wasn't dark.

This is confusing.

Alternative interpretation: Maybe "it" is the torch or the flame that Prometheus carried. When he was bringing fire to humans, the torch was lit. After he was chained, the torch was no longer being carried, so it was dark.

But humans had fire, so the world wasn't dark.

Unless the "it" is specifically the torch's flame.

So, the torch was lit when Prometheus was with mankind (carrying it to them), then after he was chained, the torch was no longer lit (maybe it was left to go out).

So "it" is the torch's flame.

But is that a well-known enough symbol to be the answer?

Alternatively, maybe "it" is the fire in Olympus or the gods' hearth. Prometheus took fire from the gods' hearth to give to humans. When he took it, the hearth was lit; after he was punished, maybe the gods extinguished it in anger, making it dark.

Not sure.

Perhaps the simplest answer is that "it" is the fire that humans had. When Prometheus was with mankind (giving them fire), it was lit; after his punishment, Zeus took away fire, making it dark.

But in the myth, humans kept the fire; Zeus punished Prometheus separately by chaining him, not by taking back fire.

Unless in some versions, fire was taken back.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is "fire" itself. "Fire was lit when Prometheus hung with mankind, but got dark after Zeus cuffed him to the mountain."

Meaning fire was present (lit) when Prometheus was with humans, but after his punishment, fire was gone (dark).

But humans kept fire, so not sure.

Wait—maybe the answer is "the torch." The torch was lit when Prometheus was with mankind (carrying fire), then after punishment, the torch was no longer used, so it was dark.

But that seems a bit obscure.

Alternatively, think of "it" as the light of knowledge or civilization. When Prometheus was helping humans, civilization was lit (advanced), after his punishment, it regressed to darkness.

But that's abstract.

Maybe the answer is simply "fire."

"Fire was lit when Prometheus hung with mankind but got real dark after Zeus cuffed him to that mountain."

Meaning fire was given to humans (lit) when Prometheus was with them, then after punishment, fire was taken away (dark).

Even if in the main myth humans kept fire, maybe the riddle simplifies it.

### Considering Other Titans

Just to be sure, is there another titan this could refer to?

Atlas: Punished to hold up the sky, not chained to a mountain.

Cronus: Imprisoned in Tartarus.

Epimetheus: Prometheus's brother, not punished in this way.

No other titans fit the "chained to a mountain by Zeus" part.

### Re-evaluating Prometheus

Prometheus is the clear fit for the titan. Now, what is "it"?

Another thought: "it" could be the sacrificial fires. In one myth, Prometheus tricked Zeus with sacrifices, hiding the good meat in an ox's stomach and presenting the bones wrapped in fat. Zeus chose the bones, setting the precedent for sacrifices where humans keep the meat and burn the bones for gods.

Maybe "it" is the sacrificial flame. When Prometheus was with mankind, the sacrificial fires were lit (used properly), but after his punishment, the fires were neglected or went out, making it dark.

But that seems a stretch.

### Simplest Answer
178 True ['plethora'] The 8-letter word derived from the Greek for "fullness" that can mean an overabundance is **"plethora."**  

- **Origin**: From Greek *plēthōrē* (πλήθωρη), meaning "fullness."  
- **Meaning**: An excessive amount or overabundance of something (e.g., "a plethora of options").  

This fits both the etymology and the definition you're seeking!
179 True ['As you Like It'] The line *"My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit"* is from **Orlando** in **William Shakespeare's *As You Like It*** (Act I, Scene 1).  

### Context:  
Orlando is complaining to his servant Adam about how his older brother Oliver has denied him an education and inheritance, despite their father's wishes. He contrasts Oliver's treatment of him with how their middle brother, Jaques, is being well-educated and praised for his progress.  

### Full Passage (Act 1, Scene 1):  
> **ORLANDO:**  
> *"My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox?"*  

This speech highlights Orlando's resentment toward Oliver's unfair treatment and sets up the conflict that drives him to leave for the Forest of Arden.  

Would you like any additional analysis or context?
180 True ['Oort'] The green comet that visited Earth in 2023, **C/2022 E3 (ZTF)**, was thought to originate from the **Oort Cloud**, named after the Dutch astronomer **Jan Oort**. 

Jan Oort proposed the existence of this distant, spherical shell of icy objects surrounding the solar system in 1950. While the exact origin of C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is uncertain, long-period comets like it are believed to come from the Oort Cloud. 

So, the answer is the **Oort Cloud**, named for Dutch astronomer **Jan Oort**.
181 True ['Croesus'] The answer to the riddle is **"as rich as Croesus."** 

In the 1696 play *The City Bride* by Joseph Harris, a character says, *"If I get a Patent, I shall be as rich as Croesus."* 

**Croesus** was the last king of Lydia (reigned c. 560–546 BCE), renowned in antiquity for his vast wealth. The phrase **"as rich as Croesus"** became a proverbial expression for extreme wealth, persisting in English and other languages to this day. 

So, the proverbially rolling-in-it king is **Croesus**.
182 True ['Germanicus'] The brother of **Claudius** and father of **Caligula** who campaigned near the Rhine but did not get his familiar name from there was **Germanicus Julius Caesar**.  

- **Germanicus** was the son of **Drusus the Elder** (brother of Tiberius) and **Antonia Minor** (daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia).  
- He was the older brother of **Claudius** and the father of **Caligula**.  
- He earned his **cognomen "Germanicus"** due to his military successes in Germania, particularly his campaigns along the Rhine.  
- However, his son **Caligula** got his nickname ("Little Boots") from the small military boots (**caligae**) he wore as a child while accompanying his father on campaigns.  

So, while **Germanicus** campaigned near the Rhine, it was **Caligula** who got his familiar name from his time with the legions—not from the Rhine itself, but from the soldiers' affectionate nickname for him.
183 True ['Parallax'] The word **"parsec"** is a portmanteau of **"parallax"** and **"second."**  

It comes from the method of measuring astronomical distances using **stellar parallax**, where one parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit (AU) subtends an angle of one arcsecond (1/3600 of a degree).  

So:  
- **"Par"** = **Parallax**  
- **"Sec"** = **Second** (arcsecond)  

This unit is commonly used in astronomy to describe large distances, such as those between stars and galaxies.
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] The question is referencing a crossover scenario where masks are compared, involving a *Friday the 13th* icon and a Robin Williams character who uses a cake moisturizer. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Friday the 13th Icon** – This is **Jason Voorhees**, the hockey-mask-wearing slasher from the franchise.  
2. **Robin Williams' Woman Who Enjoys a Cake Moisturizer** – This is **Mrs. Doubtfire** (from *Mrs. Doubtfire*, 1993), where Robin Williams' character disguises himself as an elderly woman and famously uses a cake frosting ("It was a *drive-by fruiting*!") as a makeshift facial moisturizer.  

The **crossover** you're referring to is likely from the movie ***Face/Off*** (1997), where characters literally swap faces (masks). However, the direct comparison of masks between Jason Voorhees and Mrs. Doubtfire isn't from an actual film but could be a humorous or fan-made concept (e.g., memes, mashups, or hypothetical crossovers).  

If you're thinking of a specific parody or reference (like *Dead by Daylight*'s mask comparisons or a comedy sketch), let me know! Otherwise, the answer is:  

**Jason Voorhees' hockey mask "takes on" Mrs. Doubtfire's old-lady disguise (with cake frosting as moisturizer).**  

Would love more context if you had a particular scene in mind!
185 False ['Library Paste'] The answer to your riddle is **"PVA glue"** (Polyvinyl Acetate).  

Here's the breakdown:  
- **"Put on this old 'L.P'"** hints at the word **"LP"** (as in a vinyl record), which phonetically sounds like **"El-P"** (L.P.).  
- **"Thick white adhesive"** and **"used for bookbinding"** are key properties of **PVA glue**, a common, non-toxic adhesive favored in bookbinding and crafts.  

So, when you "put on" (or think of) the old 'L.P.', you get **PVA glue**!
186 True ['Rime of the Ancient Mariner'] The poem you're referring to is *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner* by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Most stanzas in the poem are quatrains (4 lines), but there is a notable 9-line stanza that mentions a **steersman**:

> *"The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;*  
> *From the sails the dew did drip—*  
> *Till clomb above the eastern bar*  
> *The hornèd Moon, with one bright star*  
> *Within the nether tip.*  

> *One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,*  
> *Too quick for groan or sigh,*  
> *Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,*  
> *And cursed me with his eye.*  

This stanza (Part III, lines 200–208) describes the eerie moment when the Mariner's ship is haunted by supernatural forces, and the steersman is among the doomed crew members. The **hornèd Moon with a star** is one of the poem's most famous and symbolic images.  

Would you like an analysis of this passage or further context?
187 True ['Montserrat'] The island you're referring to is **Montserrat**. 

- **Columbus named it** in 1493 after the Monastery of Santa María de Montserrat in Catalonia, Spain.  
- **The French briefly controlled it** in the 17th century.  
- **The British took possession** in 1632, lost it temporarily, but regained control in 1783 under the Treaty of Paris.  

Montserrat remains a **British Overseas Territory** today. Notably, the island's Soufrière Hills volcano has been active since 1995, causing significant destruction.
188 True ['The Commitments'] Roddy Doyle's first novel, *The Commitments* (1987), is about a soulful but imaginary Irish band of the same name. The book was later adapted into a successful movie in 1991, directed by Alan Parker. The story follows a group of working-class Dubliners who form a soul band, blending American R&B with Irish grit. The novel is the first in Doyle's *Barrytown Trilogy*, followed by *The Snapper* and *The Van*. 

Would you like details on the film adaptation or the band's musical influences?
189 True ['101'] Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to think about how Carl Gauss might have approached adding up the first 100 positive integers. The story goes that he found a clever way to sum these numbers quickly, avoiding the tedious task of adding them one by one. 

### Understanding the Problem

First, let's list out what we're dealing with. The first 100 positive integers are:

1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 98, 99, 100.

We need to find the sum of all these numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100.

### Gauss's Insight

Gauss noticed that instead of adding the numbers sequentially, he could pair them in a way that each pair sums to the same value. Here's how he might have done it:

1. Pair the first and last numbers: 1 + 100 = 101.
2. Pair the second and second-to-last numbers: 2 + 99 = 101.
3. Pair the third and third-to-last numbers: 3 + 98 = 101.
4. Continue this pattern...

Do you see what's happening? Each pair is adding up to 101.

### Determining the Number of Pairs

Now, how many such pairs are there? 

We have numbers from 1 to 100, which is a total of 100 numbers. When we pair them as described, each pair consists of two numbers. So, the number of pairs is:

Number of pairs = Total numbers / Numbers per pair = 100 / 2 = 50 pairs.

### Calculating the Total Sum

Each pair sums to 101, and there are 50 such pairs. Therefore, the total sum is:

Total sum = Number of pairs × Sum of each pair = 50 × 101 = 5050.

### Verifying the Approach

Let me verify this with a smaller example to ensure it makes sense. Suppose we want to sum the first 10 positive integers:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Pairing them:

1 + 10 = 11,
2 + 9 = 11,
3 + 8 = 11,
4 + 7 = 11,
5 + 6 = 11.

Number of pairs = 10 / 2 = 5 pairs.
Total sum = 5 × 11 = 55.

Now, let's add them sequentially to check:

1 + 2 = 3,
3 + 3 = 6,
6 + 4 = 10,
10 + 5 = 15,
15 + 6 = 21,
21 + 7 = 28,
28 + 8 = 36,
36 + 9 = 45,
45 + 10 = 55.

It matches! So, the method seems correct.

### Generalizing the Formula

This approach can be generalized for the sum of the first n positive integers. The sum S is:

S = n × (first term + last term) / 2.

For n = 100:

S = 100 × (1 + 100) / 2 = 100 × 101 / 2 = 50 × 101 = 5050.

### Addressing the Original Question

The question asks: "Legend says facing a teacher's makework task to add up the first 100 positive integers, Carl Gauss quickly saw 50 pairs, each totalling what?"

From our explanation, Gauss saw that by pairing the numbers from the start and end of the sequence, each pair sums to the same value. 

- First and last: 1 + 100 = 101.
- Second and second last: 2 + 99 = 101.
- And so on.

Thus, each of the 50 pairs totals **101**.

### Final Answer

Each of the 50 pairs totals **101**. Therefore, the sum of the first 100 positive integers is 50 × 101 = 5050.
190 True ['Io'] The lover of Zeus who was turned into a cow was **Io**, a priestess of Hera in Greek mythology. 

Zeus fell in love with Io and, to protect her from his jealous wife Hera, transformed her into a white heifer (a young cow). However, Hera was not fooled and demanded the cow as a gift, then placed her under the watch of the hundred-eyed giant **Argus Panoptes**. Eventually, Hermes, at Zeus's command, slew Argus, but Hera continued to torment Io by sending a gadfly to chase her across the world. Io wandered far, eventually reaching Egypt, where Zeus restored her human form. 

This myth is one of the most famous tales of Zeus's lovers and their sufferings due to Hera's wrath.
191 True ['Kim'] The plot you're describing matches *Kim* (1901), a novel by Rudyard Kipling. 

The story follows Kimball O'Hara (Kim), an Irish orphan living in British India, who becomes involved in espionage as part of the "Great Game"—the political rivalry between Britain and Russia in Central Asia. Trained by the British Secret Service, Kim navigates Indian society while undertaking spy missions. The novel is celebrated for its vivid depiction of Indian culture and its exploration of identity, loyalty, and colonialism.
192 True ['Rum Runner'] Bill McCoy was one of the most famous **rum runners** during the Prohibition era in the United States (1920–1933). He earned the nickname **"The Real McCoy"** because he sold **high-quality, unadulterated liquor**—unlike many bootleggers who diluted or tainted their products. 

McCoy operated off the coast of the eastern U.S., smuggling genuine imported Scotch, rum, and other spirits from the Caribbean and Europe. His reputation for honesty and quality led to the popular phrase **"The Real McCoy"** being associated with authenticity. 

While the exact origin of the phrase is debated, McCoy's role in Prohibition lore cemented his place in history as a symbol of genuine, top-shelf bootlegged liquor.
193 True ['Iron Chancellor'] Otto von Bismarck's shrewd and iron-fisted style of governance earned him the nickname **"The Iron Chancellor"** (*Der Eiserne Kanzler* in German).  

The nickname combines the element **"iron"** (symbolizing his unyielding, ruthless tactics) with the title **"Chancellor"** (his position as the first Chancellor of the German Empire). It reflects his role in unifying Germany through "blood and iron" (*Blut und Eisen*) and his dominant political leadership.

195 True ['Machu Picchu'] Hiram Bingham was searching for Vilcabamba in 1911 when a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, led him to **Machu Picchu**, the now-famous "Lost City of the Incas." 

Bingham initially believed he had found Vilcabamba, the last refuge of the Inca resistance against the Spanish. However, later research confirmed that Machu Picchu was likely a royal estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, while the true Vilcabamba (Espíritu Pampa) was discovered deeper in the jungle. Nonetheless, Machu Picchu's spectacular ruins made it one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century.
196 True ['Manolo Blahnik'] The Spanish shoe designer famous for his stilettos who created shoes for Sofia Coppola's film *Marie Antoinette* (2006) is **Manolo Blahnik**.

Let me know if you'd like more details!
199 True ['Bartleby'] The title you're referring to is **"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street"** by Herman Melville.  

In this classic short story, the narrator (a lawyer) describes his office drudge, Bartleby, who initially seems like a diligent copyist but gradually withdraws into passive resistance, famously replying, **"I would prefer not to"** to any task. Early on, Bartleby is seen staring at the brick walls outside the office windows, symbolizing his isolation and detachment. By the end, he ends up in prison, where he dies staring at the high walls—a tragic conclusion to his quiet rebellion against societal expectations.  

The story is a profound meditation on alienation, capitalism, and the dehumanizing nature of modern work.
200 False ['Quincy Jones'] The person you're referring to is **Lionel Richie**. 

In the early 1980s, Lionel Richie was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and his doctors advised him to take a break from performing due to the serious health risks. Despite this, he continued working behind the scenes and went on to co-write and co-produce the iconic charity single **"We Are the World" (1985)** with Michael Jackson. The song was recorded by **USA for Africa** and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, raising millions for famine relief in Africa.

Richie eventually underwent successful surgery for his aneurysm and later returned to performing. His resilience and creativity during that period solidified his legacy as one of music's greatest talents.
201 True ['Tikrit'] Saddam Hussein was born near the city of **Tikrit**, which starts with 'T' and is located on the west bank of the Tigris River. He was born in 1937 in the village of Al-Awja, near Tikrit. 

In December 2003, Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in a farmhouse near **Ad-Dawr**, a small town also in the vicinity of Tikrit. 

So, the correct answer is **Tikrit**.
202 True ['Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'] Benjamin Walker stepped into the presidential shoes as **Abraham Lincoln** in the 2012 vampire metafiction monster mash-up movie **"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"**. 

The film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov and based on the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, reimagines Lincoln as a secret slayer of vampires, blending historical fiction with supernatural action. It’s a wild, over-the-top take on history with plenty of axe-wielding, vampire-hunting spectacle!
203 True ['Jemison'] The first African-American woman in space was **Dr. Mae Jemison**, who was inspired by Nichelle Nichols and her groundbreaking role as **Lieutenant Uhura** in *Star Trek*.  

Jemison, a physician, engineer, and NASA astronaut, flew aboard the Space Shuttle *Endeavour* on **STS-47** in **September 1992**, becoming the first Black woman to travel to space. She has often credited Nichols' portrayal of Uhura—a strong, intelligent, and capable Black woman in a futuristic, egalitarian society—as a major influence on her decision to pursue a career in science and space exploration.  

Nichelle Nichols herself played a crucial role in NASA's diversity efforts by helping recruit women and minority astronauts, including Jemison, through her work with the agency in the late 1970s. This connection highlights the powerful impact of representation in media and space exploration.  

Would you like more details on Jemison's career or Nichols' NASA outreach?
204 True ['Belshazzar'] The ruler mentioned in the Book of Daniel as the son of Nebuchadnezzar, who was killed during the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C., is **Belshazzar**. 

According to **Daniel 5**, Belshazzar was the king of Babylon when the city fell to the Persians under Cyrus the Great. During a feast, a mysterious hand wrote on the wall, foretelling his doom. That very night, Belshazzar was slain, and the Babylonian Empire was conquered by the Medes and Persians (Daniel 5:30). 

Historically, Belshazzar was not the direct son of Nebuchadnezzar but rather the son of **Nabonidus**, the last king of Babylon. However, in the biblical account, he is referred to as Nebuchadnezzar's "son" (or descendant), possibly due to a broader use of the term or because of his association with Nebuchadnezzar's dynasty. 

Thus, the answer is **Belshazzar**.
205 True ['Martin McDonagh'] The playwright you're referring to is **Martin McDonagh**, who was present on the opening night of *The Cripple of Inishmaan* in its various productions. McDonagh recently directed the film *The Banshees of Inisherin* (2022), which shares a similar Irish setting and darkly comedic tone, though it is not a direct adaptation.  

McDonagh is known for his sharp, tragicomic style in both theater (*The Pillowman*, *The Lieutenant of Inishmore*) and film (*In Bruges*, *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri*). *The Banshees of Inisherin* even reunites *In Bruges* stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.  

So, the answer is **Martin McDonagh**, linking *The Cripple of Inishmaan* (play) to *The Banshees of Inisherin* (film).
206 True ['Mohs'] The scale you're referring to is the **Mohs scale of mineral hardness**, which measures the scratch resistance of various minerals.  

On the Mohs scale:  
- **Talc** is the softest mineral, rated at **1**.  
- **Diamond** is the hardest, rated at **10**.  

The scale ranks minerals based on their ability to scratch or be scratched by another mineral. Talc is easily scratched by all other minerals on the scale, while diamond can scratch everything but cannot be scratched by any other mineral.  

Here’s a brief overview of the Mohs scale:  
1. **Talc**  
2. **Gypsum**  
3. **Calcite**  
4. **Fluorite**  
5. **Apatite**  
6. **Orthoclase (Feldspar)**  
7. **Quartz**  
8. **Topaz**  
9. **Corundum (Ruby, Sapphire)**  
10. **Diamond**  

This scale is widely used in geology, gemology, and materials science to compare hardness.
207 True ['White Noise'] The rock band **The Airborne Toxic Event** took its name from **Don DeLillo's 1985 novel *White Noise***.  

The novel features a central disaster called "the airborne toxic event," an environmental catastrophe caused by a chemical spill. In 2022, *White Noise* was adapted into a film directed by **Noah Baumbach**, starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig.  

The band's founder, **Mikel Jollett**, has cited the novel as an influence, particularly its themes of existential dread and modern anxiety.
208 True ['Karnak'] The temple complex on the right bank (east bank) of the Nile that occupies part of the site of ancient Thebes is the **Karnak Temple Complex**. 

Karnak, along with the nearby **Luxor Temple**, is located in modern-day Luxor (the site of ancient Thebes). While Luxor Temple is also on the east bank, Karnak is the larger and more expansive complex, serving as the religious heart of Thebes during the New Kingdom. 

The west bank of the Nile, in contrast, is home to mortuary temples (like the Ramesseum and Medinet Habu) and the necropolises (such as the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens). 

So, if you're specifically looking for a major temple complex on the **right (east) bank** within ancient Thebes, **Karnak** is the primary answer.
209 True ['Dan Rostenkowski'] The Illinois politician who went from power in the U.S. House to prison in the 1990s was **Dan Rostenkowski**. 

Rostenkowski, a longtime Democratic congressman from Illinois and former chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, was indicted in 1994 on corruption charges related to misuse of public funds. He pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 1996 and served 15 months in federal prison before being pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2000. 

His downfall was one of the most notable political scandals of the 1990s.
210 True ['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'] In 1976, Mario Vargas Llosa punched **Gabriel García Márquez** in the face, giving the fellow Nobel laureate a literal black eye. The incident occurred in Mexico City, and the exact reason for the altercation remains a subject of speculation, though it is often linked to personal tensions between the two literary giants. 

García Márquez (Colombian, Nobel Prize in Literature 1982) and Vargas Llosa (Peruvian, Nobel Prize in Literature 2010) were once friends but had a falling out. The other two South American Nobel laureates in literature at the time were **Pablo Neruda** (Chilean, 1971) and **Miguel Ángel Asturias** (Guatemalan, 1967), but neither was involved in the altercation. 

So, the answer is: **Gabriel García Márquez**.
211 True ['Kepler'] When Tycho Brahe died in 1601, his protégé **Johannes Kepler** succeeded him as the **Imperial Mathematician** to Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. 

Kepler inherited Tycho's extensive astronomical data, which he later used to formulate his **three laws of planetary motion**, revolutionizing our understanding of the solar system.
212 True ['Philip Glass'] The composer who created *A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close* is **Philip Glass**. In return, Chuck Close painted a portrait of Glass titled *Phil* (1969), which is one of Close's famous large-scale photorealistic works. 

Philip Glass is a minimalist composer known for his repetitive structures and immersive compositions, while Chuck Close was a renowned artist celebrated for his hyper-detailed portraits. Their mutual portraits reflect their close friendship and mutual admiration.
213 True ['Dangerous Liaisons'] The Starz prequel TV show you're referring to is **"The Great"**, but that's actually about Catherine the Great of Russia.  

The correct answer is **"The Serpent Queen"** (2022), but that focuses on Catherine de' Medici.  

It seems you might be thinking of **"Les Liaisons Dangereuses"** (Dangerous Liaisons), which features the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel. However, Starz has not produced a prequel series specifically about their younger years.  

The closest existing prequel adaptation is the 2022 French series **"Les Liaisons Dangereuses" (Dangerous Liaisons)**, which explores their origins, but it aired on **StarzPlay** (not the main Starz network).  

Would you like details on any of these shows?
214 True ['polyglot'] The 8-letter word starting with 'P' that means a speaker of many languages is **"polyglot."**

### Key Details:
1. **Origin**: The movement began underground during the Cultural Revolution but became influential in the late 1970s and 1980s.

   - **Shu Ting** (舒婷)  
   - **Gu Cheng** (顾城)  
   - **Yang Lian** (杨炼)  
4. **Cultural Revolution Context**: Their work subtly resisted Maoist orthodoxy, using indirect language to express dissent and individualism, which later led to clashes with authorities during the **Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign (1983)**.

The Misty Poets played a pivotal role in modern Chinese literature, bridging the gap between revolutionary propaganda and contemporary free expression. Their legacy remains influential in Chinese intellectual circles.
216 True ['Wings'] The war film that won the first **Best Picture** Oscar (then called **Outstanding Picture**) at the **1st Academy Awards** in 1929 was **"Wings" (1927)**.

217 True ['Bearer Bond', 'Bearer Bonds'] In banking and finance, **"B.B."** stands for **Bearer Bonds**.  

Bearer bonds are securities that are not registered in any owner's name and are payable to whoever physically holds the bond certificate. They typically come with attached coupons that the holder can redeem for interest payments.  

### Key Features of Bearer Bonds:  
- **No Registered Owner** – Ownership is determined by possession of the physical certificate.  
- **Anonymity** – Transactions are difficult to trace, making them susceptible to misuse (e.g., money laundering).  
- **Coupon Payments** – Interest is paid via detachable coupons that the holder submits for payment.  
- **Declining Use** – Due to regulatory concerns (tax evasion, fraud), many countries have phased out or heavily restricted bearer bonds.  

### Regulatory Status:  
- **U.S. & Many Countries** – Issuance of new bearer bonds is largely prohibited (e.g., U.S. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982).

  - *Super-* = "over"  
  - *Annus* = "year"  
  - Combined, *superannuated* literally means "over a year old."  

- **Meaning**:  
  While it originally referred to something aged beyond a year, it now broadly means **outdated, antiquated, or retired due to age**—similar to "obsolete."  

Other synonyms (like *archaic* or *outmoded*) don't carry this exact Latin root meaning.  

Would you like examples of usage?
219 True ['V.S. Naipaul'] The Trinidad-born author of *A House for Mr. Biswas* who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001 is **V.S. Naipaul** (Sir Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul). 

Naipaul was celebrated for his insightful and often critical portrayals of postcolonial societies, blending fiction and nonfiction in works that explore themes of displacement, identity, and cultural upheaval. *A House for Mr. Biswas* (1961), his most famous novel, draws on his Trinidadian heritage and his father's life. His Nobel Prize recognized his contributions to literature as a "perceptive traveler and the world's literary interpreter."
220 True ['Eris'] The dwarf planet you're referring to is **Eris**, named after the Greek goddess of strife and discord. Discovered in **2005**, Eris is comparable in size to Pluto and even slightly more massive, which helped prompt the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006. 

Eris is located in the scattered disc of the outer solar system and has one known moon, **Dysnomia**. Its discovery played a key role in the IAU's decision to define the term "planet" more strictly, leading to Pluto's demotion. 

Would you like more details on its composition or orbit?

Beckett is best known for his groundbreaking works such as *Waiting for Godot* (*En attendant Godot* in French), which he originally wrote in French before translating it into English himself. His minimalist and existentialist style had a profound influence on modern literature and theater. 

Though born in Ireland, Beckett spent much of his life in France and wrote many of his major works in French, later translating them into English. His bilingualism and contributions to both languages were significant factors in his Nobel Prize recognition.
223 False ['Topkapi'] The fabled palace you're referring to is **Topkapı Palace** (Topkapı Sarayı) in Istanbul, Turkey.  

Built by **Sultan Mehmed II (Mehmed the Conqueror)** after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the palace served as the administrative and royal residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly **400 years**.  

The name **"Topkapı"** means **"Cannon Gate"** in Turkish (*Top* = cannon, *kapı* = gate), derived from a nearby gate where ceremonial cannons were once placed.  

Today, it is a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** and one of the most visited museums in Turkey, showcasing Ottoman imperial treasures, relics, and stunning architecture.  

Would you like more details on its history or highlights?
224 True ['Murmansk'] The Russian port with unrestricted access to the Atlantic that is also the largest city north of the Arctic Circle is **Murmansk**.  

### Key Facts:  
- **Location**: Situated on the Kola Peninsula, Murmansk lies well above the Arctic Circle at about **68°58′N**.  
- **Port Significance**: It is Russia's **only major ice-free Arctic port**, thanks to the warm North Atlantic Current, allowing year-round navigation.  
- **Population**: With over **270,000 residents**, it is the **largest city north of the Arctic Circle** globally.  
- **Strategic Role**: A crucial hub for Arctic shipping, naval operations (home to Russia’s Northern Fleet), and the Northern Sea Route.

- **Norilsk** (also in Russia) is larger by area but has a smaller population (~180,000) and no direct ocean access.  
- **Tromsø (Norway)** and **Vorkuta (Russia)** are smaller than Murmansk.  

Murmansk’s combination of size, strategic location, and ice-free port status makes it unique in the Arctic.

### **Key Details:**
- **Date:** August 25–27, 1896  
- **Event:** The **Anglo-Zanzibar War**, considered the shortest recorded war in history (lasting between **38 and 45 minutes**).  
- **Cause:** After the death of Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini (a British ally), Khalid bin Barghash seized power without British approval, violating treaty terms.  
- **British Response:** The British demanded Khalid step down; when he refused, they bombarded his palace from nearby warships.  
- **Outcome:** Khalid fled, and the British installed their preferred candidate, **Sultan Hamoud bin Mohammed**, ensuring greater colonial control.  

This conflict marked the peak of British influence over Zanzibar, which was then a key trade hub in the Indian Ocean.

228 True ['Oliver Cromwell'] The Lord Protector who reportedly described the execution of King Charles I as a "cruel necessity" was **Oliver Cromwell**. 

Cromwell was a key figure in the Parliamentarian victory during the English Civil Wars and a leading advocate for the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649. While he supported the regicide as necessary to end tyranny and establish a republic (the Commonwealth), he acknowledged the gravity of the act with this phrase, reflecting the weight of the decision. 

After the monarchy's abolition, Cromwell later ruled as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth (1653–1658) under a quasi-republican constitution. His role in the king's execution remained controversial, both in his lifetime and afterward.
229 True ['Allocution'] The word you're looking for is **"allocution."**  

**Allocution** comes from the same Latin root as *eloquent*—*loqui*, meaning "to speak." In legal contexts, it refers to a defendant's formal speech or statement to the judge before sentencing, often expressing remorse, explaining their actions, or pleading for leniency.  

This is distinct from an *elocution* (which refers to the skill of clear speech) or a *colloquy* (a formal conversation).

231 True ['Elmore Leonard Nimoy'] Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. The question is a "before and after" style word puzzle, where the end of one word or phrase connects seamlessly with the beginning of the next. Here's the given clue:

**"In before and after, what name is joined with the Gritty 'Get Shorty' novelist who asked folks to 'Live Long and Prosper' on film?"**

### Understanding the Components

1. **"Gritty 'Get Shorty' novelist"**: 
   - "Get Shorty" is a novel. Who wrote it?
   - The author of "Get Shorty" is **Elmore Leonard**.
   - Described as "gritty," which fits Leonard's style.

2. **"who asked folks to 'Live Long and Prosper' on film"**:
   - "Live long and prosper" is the famous Vulcan greeting from "Star Trek," associated with the character **Spock**.
   - The actor who played Spock is **Leonard Nimoy**.

So, the two names we have are:
- Elmore Leonard
- Leonard Nimoy

### The "Before and After" Connection

In a "before and after" puzzle, the last part of the first term connects to the first part of the second term. Here, we're looking to join a name with these two names in a way that they share a common word or part.

Looking at:
- Elmore **Leonard**
- **Leonard** Nimoy

The overlapping part is "Leonard." So, the combined name would be:
**Elmore Leonard Nimoy**

### Verifying the Answer

Let's check if this makes sense:
- "Elmore Leonard" is the novelist.
- "Leonard Nimoy" is the actor who played Spock.
- Combining them gives "Elmore Leonard Nimoy," where "Leonard" is the shared part.

This fits the "before and after" structure perfectly.

### Final Answer

The name formed by joining the two is:

**Elmore Leonard Nimoy**
232 True ['Cyrus the Great'] Jews have a warm and appreciative historical memory of **Cyrus the Great**, the Persian emperor who conquered Babylon in 539 BCE and issued a decree allowing the Jewish exiles to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. 

This act is recorded in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in **Ezra 1:1-4** and **Isaiah 45:1**, where Cyrus is even referred to as **"God's anointed" (מָשִׁיחַ, mashiach)**—a rare honor for a non-Jewish ruler. 

Cyrus's policy of religious tolerance and support for displaced peoples earned him respect not only among Jews but also in broader ancient history. The **Cyrus Cylinder**, often called the first "charter of human rights," reflects his approach to governance, though it does not specifically mention the Jews. 

To this day, many Jews view Cyrus as a benevolent figure who played a key role in their restoration to Judea.
233 True ['Prince Albert'] The man you're referring to is **Prince Albert II of Monaco**. Here's why the titles and descriptions fit:

1. **His Serene Highness** – The traditional style of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco.  
2. **Prince of Monaco** – Albert II has been the reigning monarch since 2005.  
3. **Marquis of Baux** – A historic title held by the heir apparent of Monaco (Albert held it before becoming prince).  
4. **Man about Town** – Known for his social presence, philanthropy, and past high-profile relationships.  
5. **Dude with Some Pull** – As Monaco's ruler, he has significant influence in business, sports (e.g., Formula 1), and global diplomacy.  

The playful phrasing matches how Albert II is sometimes portrayed in media—a mix of royal duty and modern, approachable charisma.  

(Note: If this was a trivia or pop culture reference, it might also nod to his cameo in *Ocean's Twelve* as himself—reinforcing the "dude with pull" image!)
234 True ['Aye-Aye'] The rare lemur you're referring to is the **aye-aye (*Daubentonia madagascariensis*)**.  

This unique primate, native to Madagascar, has several distinctive features:  
- **Face of a possum**: Its large, round eyes and pointed snout give it a somewhat possum-like appearance.  
- **Teeth of a rat**: It has continuously growing incisors, similar to rodents.  
- **Ears of a bat**: Its large, sensitive ears help it detect insect larvae inside trees.  

The aye-aye is also known for its long, bony middle finger, which it uses to tap on wood and extract grubs—a method called **percussive foraging**. Due to its unusual appearance, it has been the subject of superstition in Malagasy folklore, sometimes considered a bad omen.  

It's the world's largest nocturnal primate and is classified as **Endangered** due to habitat loss and persecution.
235 False ['Downtrodden'] Paul Auster did not write *The New Colossus*—that poem was written by **Emma Lazarus** in 1883. However, Lazarus's sonnet, which is engraved on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty's pedestal, famously transformed the statue into a **symbol of hope for immigrants, refugees, and the dispossessed**.  

The poem's most famous lines—*"Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"*—express a welcoming message to **those fleeing oppression, poverty, and hardship**, particularly European immigrants arriving in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  

If you're referring to a specific work by Paul Auster that engages with this theme, let me know, and I can provide more details!
236 True ['For Your Eyes Only'] The collection of short stories subtitled *"Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond"* is **"For Your Eyes Only"** by Ian Fleming.  

This 1960 book includes five short stories, one of which ("From a View to a Kill") later inspired part of the title for the 1985 James Bond film *A View to a Kill*. The other stories in the collection are:  
1. *For Your Eyes Only*  
2. *Quantum of Solace*  
3. *Risico*  
4. *The Hildebrand Rarity*  

The subtitle highlights that these stories explore lesser-known moments in Bond's career.
237 True ['Dawn Treader'] Lord Drinian is the captain of the **Dawn Treader**, the titular ship in *The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*, the third book in C.S. Lewis's *The Chronicles of Narnia* series.  

In the story, the *Dawn Treader* is King Caspian X's majestic ship, on which he, along with Edmund, Lucy, and Eustace (and later Reepicheep), embark on a voyage to the eastern edge of the world in search of the seven lost lords of Narnia. Lord Drinian serves as Caspian's loyal and capable captain throughout the journey.
238 False ['Cats Cradle'] The chapters *"Ice-Nine"* and *"Tutored by Bokonon"* are from **"Cat's Cradle"** (1963), a satirical science fiction novel by **Kurt Vonnegut**.  

The book explores themes of science, religion, and human folly through the fictional substance *Ice-nine* (a dangerous form of water that freezes at room temperature) and the invented religion of *Bokononism*. The two chapters you mentioned are key parts of the novel's structure.  

Would you like more details about the book or its themes?

**"A word for booze has which 4-letter silver salmon inside of it?"**

### Understanding the Components

First, let's break down the question to understand what we're being asked.

1. **A word for booze**: This means we're looking for a synonym or a term that refers to alcoholic beverages. Common words for booze include "beer," "wine," "liquor," "ale," "rum," "gin," "vodka," etc.

2. **4-letter silver salmon**: This seems to be a clue within the word for booze. "Silver salmon" is a type of fish, also known as "coho salmon." But we're looking for a 4-letter term related to silver salmon. 

   - "Coho" is a 4-letter word referring to silver salmon.
   - Another term for silver salmon is "silver," but that's 6 letters.
   - "Salmon" itself is 6 letters.
   - "Fish" is 4 letters but too general.
   - "Coho" seems to be the most precise 4-letter term for silver salmon.

3. **Inside of it**: This suggests that the 4-letter word ("coho") is embedded within the word for booze. In other words, the letters C-O-H-O appear consecutively inside the booze word.

### Finding the Booze Word with "coho" Inside

Hmm, none of the common booze words seem to contain "coho." Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

### Re-evaluating "silver salmon"

Is "coho" the only 4-letter term for silver salmon? Let me check:

- "Coho" is indeed a name for silver salmon, scientifically Oncorhynchus kisutch.
- Other names might include "silver," but that's 6 letters.
- "Kisutch" is the species name but longer.
- "Salmon" is 6 letters.
- Maybe "fish" but too general.
- "Coho" seems correct.

### Alternative Approach: Maybe Not "coho"

Perhaps "silver salmon" refers to something else. "Silver" is Ag on the periodic table, but that's 2 letters. "Salmon" is a color, but not sure.

Alternatively, "silver salmon" could hint at the word "silver" or "salmon" in some way.

Let me think of words for booze that contain "silver" or "salmon":

- "Silver" is 6 letters, so not 4.
- "Salmon" is 6 letters.
- Maybe parts of these words.

"Salmon" has "salm," "almo," etc., but not 4-letter common words.

"Silver" has "silv," "ilve," etc., not helpful.

Wait, is there a booze called "silver something"? Like "silver tequila," but that's two words.

"Silver" is also a brand, but not a general term.

### Re-examining "coho"

Maybe the booze word is less common. Let me think of words containing "coho":

- "Cohosh" – a plant, not booze.
- "Cohort" – not booze.
- "Cohobate" – obscure, not booze.
- "Cohune" – a palm, not booze.
- "Cohabit" – not booze.
- "Cohost" – not booze.

Hmm, not finding any booze words with "coho."

### Considering Abbreviations or Slang

Maybe the booze word is slang or abbreviated. For example:

- "Brew" – no "coho."
- "Suds" – no.
- "Grog" – no.
- "Hooch" – no.
- "Booze" itself – no.
- "Sauce" – no.
- "Juice" – no.
- "Firewater" – no.
- "Rotgut" – no.
- "Gin" – no.
- "Rum" – no.

### Alternative Interpretation of "silver salmon"

Perhaps "silver salmon" is a hint towards the word "coho," but the booze word is something that sounds like or is associated with "coho."

Is there a booze that sounds like "coho"? 

- "Coho" sounds like "coho," but not a booze.
- "Cognac" – starts with "co," but not "coho."
- "Cointreau" – "coi," not "coho."
- "Corona" – beer, "cor," not "coho."
- "Cola" – not booze.
- "Coffee liqueur" – too long.

### Checking if "coho" is Part of a Larger Word

Maybe the booze word is a longer word where "coho" is inside, but not immediately obvious. For example:

- "Alcohol" – let's see: a-l-c-o-h-o-l. "coho" is in the middle: a-l-c-o-h-o-l. Yes! "coho" is right there: c-o-h-o.

So, "alcohol" is a word for booze, and inside it is "coho," which is a 4-letter silver salmon.

### Verifying "coho" in "alcohol"

Let's write "alcohol" and highlight "coho":

a l c o h o l

The sequence is: a, l, c, o, h, o, l.

"coho" is c-o-h-o, which appears consecutively.

### Verifying "coho" as Silver Salmon

Is "coho" indeed a term for silver salmon? Yes, "coho salmon" is another name for silver salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).

### Conclusion

After this step-by-step analysis, the answer is clear:

- The word for booze is "alcohol."
- Inside "alcohol," the sequence "coho" appears.
- "Coho" is a 4-letter term for silver salmon.

**Final Answer:** The word is "alcohol," which contains "coho," a 4-letter silver salmon.
240 False ['Calla'] The two-word, colorful flowers that are a type of Lily are **"Tiger Lilies"** (*Lilium lancifolium* or *Lilium tigrinum*).  

These striking flowers are known for their vibrant orange petals with dark spots, resembling a tiger's stripes. Another possible answer is **"Day Lilies"** (*Hemerocallis*), though they are not true lilies (despite the name).  

If you're looking specifically for true lilies (genus *Lilium*), **"Tiger Lilies"** is the best answer. Let me know if you'd like more details!
241 True ['Bubba Ho-Tep'] The movie you're referring to is **"Bubba Ho-Tep"** (2002). 

This cult classic stars Bruce Campbell as an aging Elvis Presley who teams up with a fellow nursing home resident (who believes he's John F. Kennedy) to battle an ancient Egyptian mummy terrorizing their retirement home. The quote is from a key scene where Elvis reveals their plan to confront the supernatural threat. 

Fun fact: The film is based on a novella by Joe R. Lansdale and blends horror, comedy, and existential themes.
242 True ['Isle of Wight'] Queen Victoria had a vacation residence on the **Isle of Wight**, which is today its own administrative county in England. Her beloved retreat was **Osborne House**, located near East Cowes. The Isle of Wight became a ceremonial and administrative county separate from Hampshire in 1974. 

Victoria spent much time there, especially after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, and it became a place of solace for her. The island remains a popular tourist destination, with Osborne House open to the public.
243 True ['Formaldehyde'] The embalming agent you're referring to is **formaldehyde**, a known carcinogen that can be released alongside methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from uncapped or abandoned oil and gas wells.  

Formaldehyde is used in embalming fluids and industrial processes, and it is also a byproduct of incomplete combustion and oil/gas extraction. Exposure to formaldehyde has been linked to cancer (particularly nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia) and other respiratory issues.  

Methane (a potent greenhouse gas) and hazardous air pollutants like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) are also commonly emitted from uncapped wells, posing significant environmental and public health risks.  

Would you like more details on regulatory efforts or mitigation strategies for these emissions?
244 True ['Berkshires'] Olympia Dukakis and Christopher Reeve regularly performed at the **Williamstown Theatre Festival**, which is located in the **Berkshire Hills** of Massachusetts. The festival takes place in Williamstown, a town in the northwestern part of the state, nestled in the scenic Berkshire Mountains. 

The Berkshires are known for their vibrant arts scene, including theater, music, and visual arts, making the Williamstown Theatre Festival a key cultural attraction in the region.
245 True ['Ceres'] The only dwarf planet that orbits the Sun closer than Neptune is **Ceres**.  

Ceres is located in the **asteroid belt** between Mars and Jupiter, making it the closest dwarf planet to the Sun. The other recognized dwarf planets in our solar system (Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake) all orbit beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt or scattered disk.  

So, the answer is: **Ceres**.
246 True ['Arthur Ashe'] The quote *"The night I met Jimmy Connors at the Wimbledon in the summer of 1975, I went to bed and slept soundly"* appears in *Days of Grace*, the autobiography of **Arthur Ashe**. 

Ashe, a legendary tennis player and civil rights activist, wrote about his life, career, and experiences, including encounters with fellow players like Jimmy Connors. The line reflects a moment of personal significance during the 1975 Wimbledon tournament, where Ashe famously defeated Connors in the final. 

Would you like more context on this passage or Ashe's memoir?
247 True ['Rhone', 'Rhône'] The river you're referring to is the **Rhône**.  

- **Source**: It originates near **Lake Geneva (Lac Léman)** in the Swiss Alps.  
- **Course**: The Rhône flows approximately **500 miles (800 km)** through Switzerland and southeastern France.  
- **Mouth**: It empties into the **Mediterranean Sea** near **Arles**, forming the **Camargue delta**, which is west of **Marseille**.  

The Rhône is a major European river, known for its historical and economic significance, particularly in trade, hydroelectric power, and agriculture (especially wine regions like the Rhône Valley).
248 True ['todo el mundo'] The Spanish word for "everybody" that literally translates to "all the world" is **"todo el mundo."**  

- **Literal meaning:** *all the world*  
- **Actual usage:** *everyone, everybody*  

Example:  
- **"Todo el mundo está feliz."** → *"Everybody is happy."*  

This phrase is commonly used in Spanish to refer to "everyone" in a general sense, even though it literally means "all the world."
249 True ['John Singer Sargent'] Theodore Roosevelt said, *"I like this picture immensely"* about his official White House portrait painted by **John Singer Sargent**. 

Sargent, a renowned American artist, created the iconic portrait in 1903 after a famously tense and dynamic session with Roosevelt, during which the president grew impatient with the painter's indecision. The resulting work captures Roosevelt's forceful personality, standing by a staircase with one hand gripping a newel post. 

While Sargent is best known by his three-part name (*John Singer Sargent*), he is not always referred to with all three names. However, he is the correct answer to your question, as no other three-named artist is associated with Roosevelt's famous quote about his portrait. 

If you were thinking of a different three-named painter, let me know—but Sargent is the most likely candidate!
250 True ['Pump and Dump', 'Pump Dump', 'Pumping and Dumping', 'Pumping Dumping', 'pump-and-dump'] The fraudulent investing scheme you're describing is called a **"pump and dump."**  

### How It Works:
1. **Pump**: Fraudsters artificially inflate (pump) a stock's price using false or misleading hype (e.g., fake news, social media spam, or exaggerated claims).  
2. **Dump**: Once the price rises due to unsuspecting investors buying in, the scammers sell (dump) their shares at the inflated price.  
3. **Crash**: The stock plummets when the hype fades, leaving other investors with worthless shares.  

### Key Traits:
- Common with **penny stocks** (low-priced, thinly traded stocks).  
- Often promoted through **social media**, forums, or spam emails.  
- Illegal under securities fraud laws (e.g., SEC regulations in the U.S.).  

### Rhyming Alternative:  
A less common but rhyming term is **"hump and dump,"** though this is slang outside finance and not the formal name for the scam.  

### Example:  
- The **GameStop (GME) short squeeze** (2021) had similarities but was driven by retail investors, not fraudsters.  
- Classic cases involve **penny stock scams** like those prosecuted by the SEC.  

Always verify investment tips and avoid "too good to be true" hype!
251 True ['Dalí', 'Dali'] In *My Last Sigh*, Luis Buñuel recalls the eccentric Spanish artist **Salvador Dalí** engaging in bizarre and provocative behavior, including seducing women and placing fried eggs on their shoulders. 

Dalí was known for his surreal antics, and Buñuel—who collaborated with him on *Un Chien Andalou* (1929)—described such outlandish episodes in his memoir. The fried eggs were likely part of Dalí's surrealist provocations, blending shock value with his fascination for absurd, dreamlike imagery. 

Would you like more details on Buñuel's anecdotes about Dalí?
252 True ['baptism'] In **Luke 3:21-22**, Jesus was about 30 years old when he underwent the ritual of **baptism** by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. This event marked the beginning of his public ministry. After his baptism, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice from heaven declared, *"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."*  

This passage highlights Jesus' identification with humanity (submitting to baptism despite being sinless) and his divine affirmation as the Son of God.
253 True ['factorial'] The exclamation mark (!) in mathematics denotes the **factorial** of a number. 

### **Factorial Definition:**
The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \).

### **Example:**
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)

### **Special Cases:**
- \( 0! = 1 \) (by definition)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

### **Applications:**
Factorials are widely used in:
- **Combinatorics** (counting permutations and combinations)
- **Probability**
- **Calculus** (Taylor series expansions)
- **Algebra** (binomial theorem)

So, in your example, \( 3! \) means the factorial of 3, which equals \( 6 \).
254 True ['Ullman'] The funny Brit you're thinking of is **Tracey Ullman**! 

She starred in her own sketch comedy series, *The Tracey Ullman Show* (1987–1990), which famously introduced *The Simpsons* in its early animated shorts. 

In the 2020 TV miniseries *Mrs. America*, Ullman played **Betty Friedan**, the feminist author and activist who wrote *The Feminine Mystique*. Ullman brought both humor and depth to the role, fitting perfectly given her comedic brilliance and dramatic range. 

Would you like any more details on her performance or career?
255 True ['Niger'] The Songhai Empire was centered in what is now **Mali**, with its capital at **Gao**. At its height, it also controlled parts of present-day **Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and The Gambia**. 

The empire reached its peak under **Askia Muhammad** but began to decline after his reign and was ultimately defeated by a **Moroccan invasion in 1591**, marking its end in the late 16th century. 

So, the primary modern West African nation associated with the Songhai Empire's reign is **Mali**.
256 True ['scallop'] The main ingredient in **Coquilles St. Jacques** is **scallops**, specifically the **adductor muscle** of the scallop, which is the tender, meaty part. 

Traditionally, this classic French dish features scallops cooked in a creamy white wine or mushroom sauce, often topped with breadcrumbs and cheese, then broiled until golden. The name *Coquilles St. Jacques* refers to the scallop shell (*coquille*) in which the dish is often served, symbolizing the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (*St. Jacques* in French). 

Other common ingredients include butter, shallots, mushrooms, and Gruyère or Parmesan cheese, but the star is always the scallop. Would you like a recipe or variations?
257 True ['mitochondria', 'mitochondrion'] The 1957 *Scientific American* article referred to the **mitochondrion** as the "Powerhouse of the Cell." This nickname highlights its crucial role in generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's primary energy currency, through aerobic respiration. The phrase became widely popular in biology education and remains a classic descriptor of mitochondrial function. 

The article, titled *"The Powerhouse of the Cell"*, was authored by **Philip Siekevitz** and appeared in the July 1957 issue (*Volume 197, Issue 1*). It explored the then-recent discoveries about mitochondrial structure and function, including their association with cellular energy production. 

Would you like details on how mitochondria produce ATP or their other roles (e.g., apoptosis, calcium storage)?
258 True ['deadlocked'] The 10-letter adjective a sports writer might use to describe a tie after a titanic struggle is **"deadlocked."**  

It means that neither team can gain an advantage, resulting in a stalemate or draw. Other possible 10-letter options could include:  
- **"Even-steven"** (though hyphenated and informal)  
- **"Level-pegged"** (more common in British English)  

But "deadlocked" is the most precise and widely recognized term in this context.
259 True ['Quisling'] During World War II, the Norwegian politician **Vidkun Quisling** collaborated with Nazi Germany after its invasion of Norway in 1940. He founded the fascist party *Nasjonal Samling* and, with German support, declared himself head of a puppet government. His name became synonymous with **traitor** ("quisling" is still used in English and other languages to mean a betrayer of one's country). 

After Germany's defeat, Quisling was arrested, tried for treason, and executed by firing squad in October 1945. His legacy remains one of infamy in Norway and beyond.
260 True ['Harder to Breathe'] The title of Maroon 5's debut single is **"Harder to Breathe"**, from their first album *Songs About Jane* (2002). 

The line *"Is there anyone out there? 'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe"* is from the song's lyrics. 

Fun fact: The song was written by Adam Levine in just 10 minutes, fueled by frustration during the album's recording process!
261 True ['Orange'] The Ernest Oppenheimer Bridge connects South Africa and Namibia and spans the **Orange River**. 

The Orange River is often referred to as "colorful" due to its striking hues, especially during sunrise and sunset, when the water reflects shades of orange and red. The river is the longest in South Africa and forms part of the border between South Africa and Namibia. The bridge is a key crossing point near the town of Oranjemund.
262 True ['Charley Pride'] Jimmy Allen's song *"Down Home"* pays tribute to the trailblazing Black country singer **Charley Pride**, who passed away in December 2020.  

The lyrics include the line:  
*"Now we got Charley Pride on the radio"*  

Pride was a groundbreaking figure in country music, breaking racial barriers in the genre and becoming one of its most successful artists. His legacy continues to inspire artists like Jimmy Allen, who honors Pride's influence in the song.
263 True ['Minoan'] The Phaistos Disc was discovered in 1908 during the excavation of the Minoan palace of **Phaistos** on the island of **Crete**. The Minoan civilization, which flourished during the Bronze Age (circa 2700–1450 BCE), is known for its advanced art, architecture, and writing systems, including **Linear A** (still undeciphered) and later **Linear B** (used for Mycenaean Greek). 

The Phaistos Disc, made of fired clay and inscribed with a unique **spiral-shaped script** of stamped symbols, remains one of archaeology's most enigmatic artifacts. Despite numerous attempts, scholars have not yet definitively decoded its meaning or determined whether it represents a form of writing, a religious text, or something else. 

Would you like more details on theories about its purpose or decipherment efforts?
264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker you're referring to is **Michel Foucault**, whose multi-volume work *The History of Sexuality* (*Histoire de la sexualité*) critically examines power dynamics in society.  

Foucault argues that power is not merely repressive but also productive, shaping discourse, knowledge, and social norms around sexuality. His analysis explores how institutions (such as medicine, law, and religion) regulate sexuality and how individuals internalize these power structures.  

Key volumes include:  
1. **The Will to Knowledge** (1976) – Introduces the concept of "biopower" and critiques the "repressive hypothesis."  
2. **The Use of Pleasure** (1984) – Examines ancient Greek sexual ethics.  
3. **The Care of the Self** (1984) – Focuses on Greco-Roman practices of self-discipline.  

Foucault's work remains foundational in critical theory, gender studies, and political philosophy. Would you like a deeper exploration of any specific volume or concept?
265 True ['Walther'] The fan letter you're referring to was written by firearms expert Geoffrey Boothroyd, who criticized Ian Fleming for equipping James Bond with the **Beretta 418**, calling it underpowered and more suited to a "lady's gun."  

In response, Fleming switched Bond's sidearm to the **Walther PPK**, a compact German-made pistol, in *Dr. No* (1958). The switch was later retroactively explained in *From Russia, with Love* (1957), where Bond is ordered to replace his Beretta after a malfunction.  

The Walther PPK became Bond's iconic firearm throughout the original novels and most of the film series.
266 True ['ooze'] On the ocean bottom, **Globigerina** is a type of **calcareous ooze**, a gooey mud composed largely of the calcium carbonate shells and skeletons of dead planktonic organisms, particularly foraminifera like *Globigerina*. 

This sediment forms in deep-sea regions above the **carbonate compensation depth (CCD)**, where calcium carbonate does not dissolve rapidly. Over time, the accumulation of these tiny shells creates a soft, fine-grained ooze that covers vast areas of the ocean floor. 

Would you like details on where it’s commonly found or how it differs from siliceous ooze?
267 True ['Brave New World'] The quote *"What you need is a gramme of Soma. All the advantages of Christianity and Alcohol - none of their defects"* is from **Aldous Huxley's** dystopian novel **"Brave New World"** (1932).  

In the novel, **Soma** is a government-distributed drug that induces euphoria and complacency, serving as a tool for social control by suppressing dissent and unhappiness. The quote reflects the novel's critique of the use of pleasure and escapism to maintain societal stability at the cost of individual freedom and genuine human experience.  

Would you like more context on the role of Soma in *Brave New World*?
268 True ['Murray'] The 1,500-mile-long Australian river whose tributaries include the **Darling** and the **Murrumbidgee** is the **Murray River**.  

The **Murray** is Australia's longest river (when combined with the Darling, it forms the **Murray-Darling Basin** system). The **Darling River** is its longest tributary, while the **Murrumbidgee** is another major tributary that joins the Murray near Balranald, New South Wales.  

Would you like more details on the Murray-Darling Basin system?
269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] Recovering from **ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction surgery** typically takes about **9 to 12 months** for a full return to sports or high-level activity. However, the **dissolving (absorbable) sutures** used in the incision usually dissolve within **2 to 3 weeks**, depending on the type of material used (e.g., Vicryl or Monocryl).  

### Key Points:  
- **ACL Recovery Timeline**:  
  - **First 3 weeks**: Focus on reducing swelling, regaining range of motion, and protecting the graft.  
  - **3–6 months**: Gradual strengthening and neuromuscular training.  
  - **6–12 months**: Sport-specific drills, agility work, and full return to activity (if cleared).  

- **Dissolvable Stitches**:  
  - Typically dissolve within **2–3 weeks**.  
  - Some may take longer (up to 6 weeks), but most are gone by the 3-week mark.  
  - No need for removal unless they cause irritation.  

If you're experiencing prolonged stitch irritation or signs of infection (redness, pus, fever), consult your surgeon. Otherwise, follow your rehab protocol for the best recovery!  

Would you like details on post-op care or rehab exercises?
270 True ['Morris'] The 19th-century Arts and Crafts movement designer you're thinking of is **William Morris**—a name that does indeed sound like it belongs to a Hollywood agent!  

Morris was a leading figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, known for his intricate, nature-inspired wallpapers and textiles. Some of his most famous floral designs include:  
- **"Rose"** (1877) – A lush, repeating pattern of roses and foliage.  
- **"Jasmine"** (1872) – A delicate trellis design with intertwining jasmine flowers.  

His work emphasized handcrafted beauty, medieval influences, and a rejection of industrial mass production. If you've ever seen a richly detailed, botanical wallpaper that looks like it belongs in a Victorian manor, there's a good chance it was one of Morris's designs!  

(And yes, "William Morris" does sound like the guy who could negotiate your next blockbuster deal.)
271 True ['Addams Family Values'] The movie you're referring is **"Addams Family Values"** (1993), the sequel to "The Addams Family" (1991).  

The title plays on the phrase **"Addams Family Values"** as a before-and-after, where:  
- **"Addams Family"** (the family name) + **"Family Values"** (a common phrase about moral principles) combine to form the title.  

In the film, Wednesday and Pugsley are indeed sent to a summer camp, leading to some darkly comedic moments.
272 True ['Done', 'Dun'] The words **"finished"** and **"drab"** describe the homophones **"done"** and **"dun"**.  

- **Done** (finished, completed)  
- **Dun** (dull, drab in color)  

These two words sound alike but have different meanings, making them homophones.
273 True ['Zworykin'] In 1923, **Vladimir Zworykin**, a Russian immigrant, filed a patent for the **Iconoscope**, the first practical television transmission tube. 

Zworykin, who later became a key figure in the development of television technology while working for **RCA (Radio Corporation of America)**, is often credited as one of the pioneers of electronic television. His work built upon earlier concepts, but the Iconoscope became a foundational component in early TV cameras. 

Would you like more details on his contributions or the evolution of television technology?
274 False ['Sharp Objects and Gone Girl', 'Sharp Objects Gone Girl'] "Sharp Girl" (シャープ・ガール) is a Japanese light novel series written by **Yukako Kabei** (かべいゆかこ). Within this series, there are two books that are actually standalone novels by the same author, republished as part of the "Sharp Girl" label. These two books are:

1. **"Kieli" (キーリ)** – Originally published in 2003, later included in the "Sharp Girl" series.  
2. **"The God of Death and the Red Shoes" (死神と赤い靴)** – Originally published in 2005, also republished under the "Sharp Girl" label.

Both novels share Yukako Kabei's distinctive style of blending fantasy, dark themes, and emotional depth, which is why they were grouped under the "Sharp Girl" branding. 

Would you like more details on either of these books?
275 True ['Bayreuth'] The German music festival starting with 'B' that has been presenting the works of Richard Wagner since 1876 is the **Bayreuth Festival** (German: *Bayreuther Festspiele*). 

Held annually in the town of Bayreuth, Bavaria, this prestigious event is dedicated exclusively to Wagner's operas. It takes place in the **Bayreuth Festspielhaus**, a theater designed by Wagner himself to accommodate his epic works, particularly the *Ring Cycle* (*Der Ring des Nibelungen*). The festival was founded by Wagner and remains a major cultural event, often attended by classical music enthusiasts and dignitaries from around the world. 

Would you like details on its history or current iterations?
276 True ['Hoyle'] The 18th-century whist expert and author you're referring to is **Edmond Hoyle**. His name is often invoked as an authority on card games, as in phrases like *"According to Hoyle..."*  

Hoyle wrote *"A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist"* (1742), which became immensely popular and established him as an authority on game rules. Later, his name was attached to rulebooks for other games, and the phrase *"according to Hoyle"* became synonymous with correct play or proper procedure in card games and beyond.

279 True ['wasp'] New Mexico chose the **tarantula hawk** (*Pepsis spp.* or *Hemipepsis spp.*) as its state insect in 1989. The tarantula hawk is a type of **large wasp** known for its painful sting and its unique behavior of hunting tarantulas. 

These wasps paralyze tarantulas with their venomous sting, then drag the immobilized spider to a burrow where they lay an egg on it. When the egg hatches, the larva feeds on the still-living tarantula. 

Interestingly, the tarantula hawk's sting is considered one of the most painful insect stings in the world (ranked near the top of the Schmidt Sting Pain Index), though it is not aggressive toward humans unless provoked. 

So, the answer to your question is: the tarantula hawk is a type of **wasp**.
280 True ['Cronkite'] This is a clever question that plays on the names and timelines of two prominent news anchors. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **CBS News anchor who stepped down in 1981**: This refers to **Walter Cronkite**, who retired from CBS Evening News in 1981. Cronkite was often referred to as "the most trusted man in America."

2. **Peter Mansbridge**, who stepped down from CBC in 2017, was sometimes referred to as **"the most trusted man in Canada"**, echoing Cronkite's famous moniker. 

Thus, the answer is: **"most trusted man."** 

After Cronkite stepped down in 1981, Mansbridge (who became a prominent anchor in Canada) was often called the "most trusted man in Canada," mirroring Cronkite's title.
281 True ['Graham'] The 1949 article is likely referring to the evangelist **Billy Graham**, whose revival meetings drew massive crowds in large tents during the late 1940s and early 1950s. 

One of his most famous early campaigns was the **Los Angeles Crusade (1949)**, where his tent meetings attracted over 20,000 people nightly, gaining national attention and launching his career as a leading evangelist. The event was held under a massive "Canvas Cathedral" tent, and media coverage, including *TIME* and *Life* magazines, helped propel Graham to fame. 

Would you like details on a specific campaign or location?
282 True ['Odenkirk'] The actor who traded the courtroom for the classroom and returned to AMC in *Lucky Hank* is **Bob Odenkirk**. 

Odenkirk is best known for his role as Saul Goodman in *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul* (the courtroom reference), and in *Lucky Hank*, he plays a disillusioned English professor at a small-town college. The series aired on AMC in 2023.
283 False ['lowkey'] The slang word you're thinking of is **"OTP" (low-key OTP when X is the vibe)**—but that doesn't quite fit.  

The correct answer is likely **"low-key"**, which is often used similarly to "down-low" (meaning secretly or subtly).  

For example:  
- *"He's low-key goated when cooking is the vibe."* (meaning he's secretly/underratedly the best when cooking is the mood).  

If you meant a different "low" slang term, let me know! But "low-key" is the most common one used in phrases like this.
284 True ['Cloisters'] The novel Jenna Bush recommended, which is as Gothic as you can get and is named for and set at The Met's branch dedicated to medieval art, is *The Cloisters* by Katy Hays.  

This Gothic thriller is set in **The Met Cloisters**, the branch of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City that specializes in medieval European art and architecture. The museum's design and atmosphere heavily influence the novel's dark, mysterious tone.  

Would you like more details about the book or the museum?

This extinct volcanic tuff cone was formed over 75,000 years ago and holds deep cultural and historical significance. The cemetery was established in 1949 and serves as the final resting place for thousands of American service members, including many from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. 

The site is also home to the **Punchbowl Memorial**, which features the **Courts of the Missing**, a memorial to those missing in action or lost at sea, as well as beautiful mosaics and battle maps honoring the Pacific Theater of World War II. 

Would you like more details on its history or visiting information?
286 False ['Healall'] Robert Frost's poem *"Design"* features the **white heal-all** (*Prunella vulgaris*), a flower traditionally known for its medicinal and curative properties. The poem ironically juxtaposes the flower's healing reputation with a dark scene involving a spider and a moth, exploring themes of fate and malevolence in nature.  

Here’s the relevant opening line:  
*"I found a dimpled spider, fat and white, / On a white heal-all, holding up a moth"*  

The heal-all’s symbolic contrast with the poem’s sinister imagery underscores Frost’s meditation on design (or lack thereof) in the natural world.
287 True ['Gastroenteritis'] The Norovirus is a common cause of **gastroenteritis**, which is the 15-letter inflammation of the stomach lining and intestines. 

Here's the breakdown:
- **Gastroenteritis** (15 letters): *Gastro* (stomach) + *enter* (intestines) + *itis* (inflammation). 

This condition is often marked by symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Let me know if you'd like more details!
288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. The clue mentions several actors and a scenario, and asks for a movie title "before and after." This suggests we're dealing with a "Movie Title Before and After" puzzle, where the end of one movie title connects with the beginning of another to form a combined phrase.

### Understanding the Clues

1. **Actors and Scenario:**
   - **Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach fight for gold:** This is a clear reference to the 1966 spaghetti Western *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*, directed by Sergio Leone. These three actors play the titular characters: Clint Eastwood as "The Good" (Blondie), Lee Van Cleef as "The Bad" (Angel Eyes), and Eli Wallach as "The Ugly" (Tuco). The plot revolves around their pursuit of Confederate gold.
   
   - **Marlon Brando gives Yanks a bad name overseas:** This is a bit more obscure. "Yanks" is a term for Americans, and giving them a bad name overseas suggests a negative portrayal of Americans abroad. Marlon Brando starred in *The Ugly American* (1963), where he played an American ambassador whose actions give Americans a bad reputation in a Southeast Asian country.

2. **Movie Title Before and After:**
   - The "before and after" format implies that the last word of the first movie title is the first word of the second movie title, creating a combined phrase where one word is shared between the two titles.

### Identifying the Movies

From the clues:
- First movie: *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*
- Second movie: *The Ugly American*

Now, let's see how they connect:
- The last word of the first movie is "Ugly."
- The first word of the second movie is "The," but the significant word is "Ugly," which is the second word in the title *The Ugly American*.

However, in "before and after" puzzles, it's common to overlap the exact same word, even if it's part of a longer title. So, we can take "Ugly" from the end of the first title and the start of the second title (even though it's preceded by "The").

### Combining the Titles

So, combining:
- *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* + *The Ugly American* = *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly American*

Here, "Ugly" is the overlapping word that connects the two titles.

### Verifying the Answer

Let's check if this makes sense:
- *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* is correctly identified based on the actors and the gold plot.
- *The Ugly American* fits the Marlon Brando clue.
- Combining them at "Ugly" gives a coherent phrase: *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly American*.

This seems correct.

### Potential Alternative Interpretation

Could there be another way to interpret this? For instance, is there another movie with "Ugly" at the end that could connect with another movie starting with "Ugly"? 

- *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* is the most famous with "Ugly" at the end.
- *The Ugly American* is the primary movie associated with Marlon Brando and the "bad name overseas" clue.

No other obvious combinations come to mind that fit the given clues better.

### Final Answer

After carefully analyzing the clues and the possible movie titles, the answer is:

**The Good, the Bad and the Ugly American**

This combines:
- *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*
- *The Ugly American*

with "Ugly" being the overlapping word.
289 True ['Shinto'] The Torii gates, which mark the boundary between the secular world and the sacred, are associated with **Shinto**, the indigenous spirituality of Japan often referred to as the **"Way of the Gods"** (*神道, Shintō*). 

In Shinto belief, Torii gates symbolize the transition from the mundane to the sacred space of a shrine, where *kami* (spirits or deities) reside. They are a distinctive architectural feature of Shinto shrines and hold deep cultural and religious significance.
290 True ['Reposado'] The type of tequila you're referring to is **"Reposado"**, which translates from Spanish as "rested" or "aged."  

Reposado tequila is aged in oak barrels for **a minimum of two months but less than a year**, allowing it to develop a smooth, mellow flavor and a **golden hue**. The aging process gives it subtle notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak while retaining the agave's natural character.  

For comparison:  
- **Blanco** (unaged, clear)  
- **Reposado** (rested, golden)  
- **Añejo** (aged 1–3 years, darker amber)  
- **Extra Añejo** (aged 3+ years, deep rich color)  

So, if you're looking for a tequila that's taken a "siesta" in the barrel, **Reposado** is your answer! 🥃✨
291 True ['Stockholm'] The capital city where August Strindberg, the legendary Swedish playwright and master of drama, took his final bow in 1912 was **Stockholm**. True to form, Strindberg's life and death were steeped in intensity—fitting for a man who revolutionized modern theater with works like *Miss Julie* and *The Ghost Sonata*. 

He died in his home at **85 Drottninggatan**, leaving behind a legacy that forever changed Scandinavian literature and drama. Stockholm, the dramatic heart of Sweden, was the perfect stage for his exit.
292 True ['Hagar'] When Sarah (originally named Sarai) thought she was unable to bear children for Abraham (originally Abram), she gave him her Egyptian handmaid **Hagar** to be his wife. Hagar then bore Abraham a son named **Ishmael**. 

This account is found in **Genesis 16:1-15** (KJV):  
*"Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."* (Genesis 16:1-2)  

Later, Hagar conceived and gave birth to Ishmael when Abraham was 86 years old (Genesis 16:16).  

Would you like further details on this story or its significance?
293 True ['Gluon'] Inside protons and neutrons, quarks are bound together by particles called **gluons**. The name "gluon" comes from the word "glue," reflecting their role in "sticking" quarks together via the **strong nuclear force** (or strong interaction), which is mediated by these particles. 

Gluons are the force carriers of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing how quarks interact. Unlike photons in electromagnetism, which are electrically neutral, gluons themselves carry a "color charge" (related to the strong force), allowing them to interact with each other, which contributes to the complexity and strength of the binding force. This interaction is what holds quarks confined within protons, neutrons, and other hadrons.
294 True ['Tessera', 'Tessellation', 'tessellated'] The word you're looking for is **"tessellated"** or **"tessellation."**  

- **Tessellated** refers to a surface decorated with a mosaic of small, repeating squares or tiles (often in geometric patterns).  
- **Tessellation** is the arrangement of shapes (like squares, hexagons, or triangles) that fit together without gaps.  

While **"mosaic"** broadly refers to artwork made of small pieces, **"tessellated"** specifically emphasizes the geometric, repeating pattern—common in flooring designs.  

Would you like a specific term for a certain style (e.g., Roman, Byzantine, or modern)?
295 True ['My So-Called Life', 'My So Called Life'] As a teen, Claire Danes starred as Angela Chase in the critically acclaimed television series **"My So-Called Life"** (1994–1995). The show explored the trials and tribulations of adolescence, tackling issues like identity, relationships, and family dynamics with raw honesty. Though it only lasted one season, it became a cult classic and cemented Danes' early stardom.
296 True ['coati'] The shorted 5-letter name for the raccoon cousins found in Arizona, New Mexico, and further south is **"coati"** (pronounced koh-AH-tee).  

Coatis are part of the Procyonidae family, related to raccoons, and are known for their long, ringed tails and curious snouts. The two main species are the **white-nosed coati** (*Nasua narica*) and the **South American coati** (*Nasua nasua*). They're often called "coatimundis" in some regions, but "coati" is the commonly shortened form.
297 True ['Irene Cara'] The person you're referring to is **Irene Cara**, the talented singer and actress who performed the iconic song *"Flashdance... What a Feeling"* from the 1983 film *Flashdance*. Sadly, Cara passed away on **November 25, 2022**, at the age of 63. Her song was added to the **National Recording Registry** by the Library of Congress in **2023**, meaning she did not live to see this honor. 

Cara was also known for her role in *Fame* (1980) and for singing its title track, *"Fame."* Her contributions to music and film remain celebrated.
298 True ['JuJu', 'joujou', 'gris'] In Voodoo shops, you can purchase **mojo bags** (also called **gris-gris bags, conjure bags, or charm bags**). These small cloth pouches are filled with a variety of magical ingredients designed to protect the wearer, attract luck, love, money, or other desired outcomes.  

### Common Ingredients in Mojo Bags:  
- **Herbs & Roots** (e.g., John the Conqueror root, High John, Low John, angelica root)  
- **Mineral & Stones** (e.g., lodestone for attraction, black tourmaline for protection)  
- **Personal Items** (hair, nails, or a written petition)  
- **Symbolic Objects** (coins for wealth, red pepper for power, or a small saint medal)  
- **Oils & Powders** (such as Fast Luck Oil or Protection Powder)  

These bags are traditionally carried on the person (often in a pocket or under clothing) and are "fed" with oils or whiskey to keep them spiritually active.  

Would you like a specific recipe for a particular purpose (love, protection, success)?
299 False ['Shelley'] The poet you're describing is **John Keats**. Here's why the clues fit:

1. **"An unabashed romantic"** – Keats was a key figure in the **Romantic movement**, known for his passionate, sensuous poetry celebrating beauty and emotion.
2. **"'Unbound' effort"** – This likely refers to his epic poem *Hyperion*, which was unfinished ("unbound") and dealt with mythological themes. Alternatively, it could hint at his **"Ode to a Nightingale"** ("unbound" as in free, transcendent).
3. **"Drowning his sorrows"** – Keats faced immense personal suffering, including the death of his brother from tuberculosis, financial struggles, and his own terminal illness. His poetry often reflects melancholy and escapism (e.g., *"Ode to a Nightingale"*: *"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains..."*).

Keats died young (age 25) but left a profound legacy. If you were thinking of someone else, let me know—but he’s the strongest match!
300 True ['Burundi'] The country you're referring to is **Burundi**. 

In Burundi, the **Hutu** ethnic group makes up the majority of the population, while the **Tutsi** minority historically held political and military power, particularly before and during periods of conflict, such as the Burundian Civil War (1993–2005). This dynamic mirrors the ethnic power structures seen in neighboring Rwanda. 

Would you like more details on Burundi's history or the Hutu-Tutsi divide?
301 True ['Carillon'] The word you're looking for is **"carillon."**  

A **carillon** is a musical instrument consisting of at least **23 cast bronze bells** (and can have up to **77 or more**) arranged in chromatic sequence and tuned to produce harmonious tones when struck. It is typically housed in a bell tower or belfry and played using a keyboard or an automatic mechanism.  

The largest carillons can have **77 or 78 bells**, covering a wide musical range. If the instrument has fewer than 23 bells, it is usually called a **"chime"** rather than a carillon.  

Would you like to know more about how carillons are played or their history?
302 False ['Leslie Groves'] The "indispensable man" of the Manhattan Project was **General Leslie R. Groves**, the hard-driving U.S. Army officer who oversaw the project from its inception to the successful testing and wartime deployment of the atomic bomb.  

Appointed in September 1942, Groves was a no-nonsense, highly effective administrator who managed the vast scientific, industrial, and logistical challenges of the project. He selected key sites (such as Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Hanford), secured resources, and worked closely with scientists like J. Robert Oppenheimer to ensure the bomb's development stayed on track. His leadership was crucial in delivering the atomic bombs ("Little Boy" and "Fat Man") in time for use in World War II.  

The term "indispensable man" was later popularized in reference to Groves due to his relentless drive and organizational genius in making the Manhattan Project a success.
303 True ['Chicago'] The Haymarket Affair, also known as the Haymarket Riot or Haymarket Massacre, occurred in **Chicago, Illinois**, on May 4, 1886. 

The event began as a peaceful labor rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour workday. However, after police attempted to disperse the crowd, an unknown person threw a bomb at officers, leading to chaos. The explosion and subsequent gunfire resulted in the deaths of **seven police officers** and at least **four civilians**, with many more injured. 

The aftermath saw a controversial trial in which eight anarchists were convicted, despite a lack of direct evidence linking them to the bombing. Four were executed, one died by suicide in jail, and the remaining three were later pardoned. The Haymarket Affair became a pivotal moment in labor history and is commemorated internationally as **May Day (International Workers' Day)**.
304 True ['Typee'] Herman Melville's first novel, subtitled *"A Peep at Polynesian Life,"* is **"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life"** (1846). 

This semi-autobiographical work was based on Melville's own experiences in the South Pacific, particularly his time among the Typee people in the Marquesas Islands after deserting a whaling ship. The novel blends adventure, travelogue, and cultural observation, and it was Melville's literary debut, establishing his early reputation as a writer.
305 True ['griot'] In *Night of the Kings* (*La Nuit des Rois*), the protagonist, a young prisoner named Roman, is forced to take on the role of a **griot** (or *djeli* in Manding languages) to survive. 

In the film, set in the notorious MACA prison in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Roman must tell an epic story throughout the night to entertain the inmates and the prison's self-proclaimed king, Blackbeard. The tradition of the griot—a West African oral historian, poet, and storyteller—is central to the film's narrative structure. By embodying this role, Roman weaves a tale that keeps his audience captivated, mirroring the griot's ancient function of preserving history and culture through storytelling. 

If he fails to keep the story alive until dawn, his life is at risk, heightening the tension between performance and survival. The film beautifully blends elements of African oral tradition with a gripping prison drama.
306 True ['Eat, Pray, Love', 'Eat Pray Love'] The Elizabeth Gilbert title that spent **57 weeks** at No. 1 on *The New York Times* paperback nonfiction bestseller list is **"Eat, Pray, Love"**.  

Published in 2006, this memoir chronicles Gilbert's journey of self-discovery through Italy, India, and Indonesia. It became a cultural phenomenon and remained a bestseller for years, holding the top spot in paperback nonfiction for an impressive **57 weeks** (as of the last available data).  

Would you like details on its impact or adaptations?
307 True ['Marcel'] Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. The riddle goes:

"'Wave' goodbye to which boy's first name and hairstyling term; it hasn't been a popular name in France since the 1920s?"

### Understanding the Components

First, let's break down the riddle to understand what we're dealing with.

1. **"Wave" goodbye to which boy's first name and hairstyling term**: This suggests that we're looking for a boy's name that is also a hairstyling term, and somehow related to the word "wave."
   
2. **It hasn't been a popular name in France since the 1920s**: This gives us a historical context clue about the name's popularity in France.

### Identifying the Hairstyling Term Related to "Wave"

The word "wave" in the context of hairstyling likely refers to a hairstyle that has waves. One common hairstyling term that comes to mind is "perm," short for permanent wave. A perm is a chemical treatment that adds waves or curls to the hair.

But is "perm" a boy's first name? Not commonly. So, maybe "perm" isn't the right term here.

Another hairstyling term related to waves is "marcel wave." The Marcel wave is a hairstyle that was very popular in the 1920s, characterized by deep, soft waves. It was created using a special curling iron called the Marcel iron.

Now, "Marcel" is a boy's first name, and it's also the name associated with this hairstyling term. 

### Checking the Name's Popularity in France

Next, we need to verify if "Marcel" was a popular name in France and if its popularity declined after the 1920s.

Marcel is indeed a French male given name. It was quite popular in the early 20th century but has seen a decline in popularity since then, especially after the 1920s. This fits the clue provided.

### Connecting "Wave" to "Marcel"

Now, how does "wave" connect to "Marcel"? As mentioned, the Marcel wave is a specific type of hairstyle involving waves. So, if we're saying "wave" goodbye to "Marcel," it implies removing or saying goodbye to the "wave" part of "Marcel wave," leaving us with just "Marcel."

### Verifying the Answer

Let's put it all together:

- Hairstyling term related to "wave": Marcel wave
- Boy's first name within that term: Marcel
- Popularity in France: Marcel was popular but declined after the 1920s
- "Wave" goodbye to "Marcel wave" implies focusing on "Marcel"

This seems to fit perfectly.

### Considering Alternatives

Is there another name that could fit? Let's think of other hairstyling terms with "wave":

- Finger wave: Not a name.
- Beach wave: Not a name.
- Perm: As mentioned, not a name.
  
"Marcel" seems to be the only name that fits both the hairstyling term and the historical popularity clue.

### Final Confirmation

To ensure this is correct, let's think about the phrase "wave goodbye to Marcel." It's a play on words where "wave" refers to the "Marcel wave," and saying goodbye to it leaves us with the name "Marcel."

Given that, and considering the historical context of the name's popularity in France, "Marcel" is the most fitting answer.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing each part of the riddle and considering possible interpretations, the answer is:

**Marcel**. 

"Marcel" is a boy's first name that is also part of the hairstyling term "Marcel wave." The name was popular in France but has declined in popularity since the 1920s. Saying "wave" goodbye to "Marcel wave" leaves us with the name "Marcel."
308 True ['Livy'] The ancient scholar who wrote a 142-volume history of Rome, including accounts of the battles against Hannibal, was **Titus Livius**, commonly known as **Livy**.  

His monumental work, *Ab Urbe Condita* ("From the Founding of the City"), covered Roman history from its legendary origins (traditionally 753 BCE) up to his own time (the reign of Augustus). While Livy's full work originally comprised 142 books, only about 35 survive today (Books 1–10 and 21–45). The surviving portions include detailed accounts of the **Second Punic War (218–201 BCE)**, particularly Hannibal's invasion of Italy and key battles like **Cannae** and **Zama**.  

Livy's history blended historical research with moral and patriotic storytelling, making it a foundational source for later Roman historians.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] The book you're referring to is *"Two Years Before the Mast"* by Richard Henry Dana Jr., published in 1840 (not 1855). However, the phrase you're thinking of—meaning "Let's head in a certain direction"—is likely **"Go Down, Moses"** (though that's a spiritual, not a book title).  

If you meant a phrase from literature that suggests setting a course or direction, another possibility is **"Moby-Dick"** (1851) by Herman Melville, but that doesn't quite fit.  

Alternatively, the phrase **"Sailing Directions"** (a nautical term) might be what you're recalling, but it's not from a famous book.  

Could you clarify or confirm if you're thinking of a different title?
310 True ['Pangaea'] Millions of years ago, all the continents were combined into a supercontinent called **Pangaea** (also spelled **Pangea**), which comes from the Greek words **"pan"** (meaning "all") and **"gaia"** (meaning "Earth"), translating to **"All Earth."**  

Pangaea existed during the late **Paleozoic** and early **Mesozoic eras** (about **335–175 million years ago**) before gradually breaking apart due to **plate tectonics**, forming the continents as we know them today.  

Would you like details on how Pangaea split or evidence supporting its existence?
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] "War Pigs" is a song by the legendary British heavy metal band **Black Sabbath**. The track, from their 1970 album *Paranoid*, is a powerful anti-war statement that criticizes the hypocrisy of political and military leaders who send young people to die in wars while claiming moral or religious righteousness. 

The song's original title was "Walpurgis," referencing a pagan festival often associated with witchcraft, but it was changed to "War Pigs" to emphasize its anti-war message. The lyrics portray war profiteers and warmongers as the true evil, suggesting that their actions are more satanic than any occult imagery. 

So, in essence, **Black Sabbath** used "War Pigs" to convey that war itself—and those who orchestrate it—are the real Satanism.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] The famous Texas attraction you're referring to is **Cadillac Ranch** in Amarillo!  

This iconic public art installation features **10 colorful Cadillacs half-buried nose-down in the ground**, representing the "Golden Age" of American automobiles (1949–1963). Visitors are encouraged to bring spray paint and leave their mark on the cars, which are constantly evolving with layers of graffiti.  

So yeah, dudes—hold onto your car (metaphorically or literally, depending on wind conditions) and enjoy this quirky roadside gem! 🚗🎨
313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] The eccentric 16th-century Danish astronomer you're referring to is **Tycho Brahe**. 

A recent exhumation and analysis of his remains in 2010 revealed that his famous prosthetic nose—which he wore after losing part of his own in a duel—was likely made of **brass** rather than the long-held belief that it was gold or silver. Chemical analysis of greenish stains on his skull suggested the presence of copper and zinc, consistent with a brass alloy. 

Brahe was known for his meticulous astronomical observations and flamboyant personality, and his metal nose has become one of the most famous quirks in the history of science.
314 True ['Peccadillo'] The word you're looking for is **"peccadillo."**  

- It means a minor fault or quirk.  
- It comes from the Spanish word *"pecadillo,"* the diminutive of *"pecado"* (meaning "sin").  
- The double "L" in the spelling fits your criteria.  

So, **peccadillo** perfectly matches all the given clues!
315 True ['Xerxes'] The Battle of Salamis in 480 B.C. saw the Greek navies face off against the forces of **Xerxes I**, the son of **Darius I** of Persia. 

Xerxes led the massive Persian invasion of Greece, seeking to avenge his father's earlier defeat at the Battle of Marathon (490 B.C.). However, the outnumbered Greek fleet, primarily led by the Athenian commander **Themistocles**, decisively defeated the Persians at Salamis, marking a turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars.
316 True ['Air Force Quit'] Alright, let's tackle this puzzle step by step. The question is asking for a "before and after phrase" that's combined from the given scenario: 

"A nation's military planes get frozen and you have to hit a combination of keys on your mac or PC to exit them."

### Understanding "Before and After" Phrases

First, what is a "before and after" phrase? It's a type of word puzzle where two separate phrases or terms share a common word, and when combined, they form a new, continuous phrase. For example, "peanut butter and jelly sandwich" could be a before and after where "peanut butter" and "butter and jelly sandwich" share the word "butter."

### Analyzing the Given Scenario

Now, let's break down the given scenario to identify potential phrases:

1. **"A nation's military planes get frozen"**
   - Military planes of a nation are often referred to as the "air force." 
   - "Get frozen" can imply turning into ice or being stuck, which might relate to "freeze" or "force" (as in "force" can sound like "froze" with some wordplay).

   Combining these, "air force" + "frozen" might lead us to "Air Force One," which is the presidential aircraft of the United States. But "frozen" isn't directly part of that. Alternatively, "air force" + "freeze" could be "force freeze," but that doesn't seem to fit.

   Another angle: "military planes" could be "jets," and "frozen" could be "ice," leading to "jet ice," which doesn't seem right.

   Maybe "air force" is the key here. Let's hold onto that.

2. **"you have to hit a combination of keys on your mac or PC to exit them"**
   - A combination of keys on a computer is a "keyboard shortcut" or more specifically, a "key command."
   - "To exit them" often refers to pressing keys like "Esc" (Escape) or "Ctrl + Alt + Del" to exit a frozen state.
   - Common key combinations to exit or force quit applications include "Command + Q" (on Mac) or "Alt + F4" (on PC), but these are specific.
   - The general term might be "force quit," where you force an application to quit.

   So, "force quit" seems relevant here.

### Combining the Two Parts

Now, we have two potential phrases:
- From the first part: "air force"
- From the second part: "force quit"

Notice that both phrases share the word "force." 

So, the "before" phrase could be "air force," and the "after" phrase could be "force quit," combining to form "air force quit."

But does "air force quit" make sense as a combined phrase? Not really; it doesn't seem meaningful.

Wait, maybe the order is reversed. If we think of "force quit" first, then "quit" could lead to another phrase starting with "quit," like "quit smoking," but that doesn't connect back.

Alternatively, maybe the shared word is "force," and the phrases are "air force" and "force quit," but the combination isn't meaningful.

Perhaps we're missing something. Let's think differently.

### Re-evaluating "A nation's military planes get frozen"

"Military planes" could be "jets," and "get frozen" could be "iced," leading to "jets iced," which sounds like "jet ski'd," but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, "military planes" are "fighters," and "frozen" is "ice," so "fighters ice," which doesn't make sense.

Wait, "air force" is the military branch with planes. "Air force" + something with "force."

"Force" is also in "force quit." So "air force quit" is the combination, but as said, not meaningful.

Is there another interpretation of "get frozen"? Maybe "freeze" as in "freeze frame," but not sure.

Alternatively, "frozen" could imply "stuck," leading to "air force stuck," no.

Wait, in computing, "frozen" means the program is not responding, and you might "force quit" it.

So, "air force" (before) + "force quit" (after) = "air force quit."

Is "air force quit" a known phrase? Doesn't seem so.

Maybe the answer is simply the combination of the two phrases sharing "force": "air force quit."

But usually, before and after phrases combine to form something recognizable. Maybe we're missing a better pair.

### Alternative Approach: Keyboard Shortcut for Exiting Frozen Programs

The main keyboard shortcut to exit a frozen program on a Mac is "Command + Option + Esc," which brings up the "Force Quit Applications" window. On Windows, it's "Ctrl + Alt + Del," then select "Task Manager" to end tasks.

"Force quit" is the term used here. So, "force quit" is likely part of the after phrase.

Now, what comes before "force"? "Air force" is the only thing that comes to mind from the first part.

So, "air force" + "force quit" = "air force quit."

Is there a better before phrase ending with "force"? Maybe "task force," but that's not from the first part.

"Air force" seems the only relevant one.

### Verifying "Air Force Quit"

Is "air force quit" a known term? Not that I'm aware of. Maybe it's intended to be a play on words where "air force quit" sounds like something else, but I can't think of anything.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is supposed to be the two separate phrases sharing the word, not necessarily forming a new meaningful phrase.

In that case, the before and after phrases are "air force" and "force quit," sharing "force."

### Considering Other Possibilities

Is there another way to interpret "military planes get frozen"?

"Frozen" could imply "ice," leading to "air ice," no.

"Military planes" could be "bombers," "fighters," but not matching well.

"Air force" seems the most direct.

### Final Thoughts

Given the information, the most plausible before and after phrases are:

- Before: "air force" (a nation's military planes)
- After: "force quit" (hitting keys to exit frozen programs)
- Combined: "air force quit"

While "air force quit" isn't a standard phrase, the two parts share the word "force," which is typical in before and after puzzles.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing both parts of the scenario and considering possible interpretations, the before and after phrase combination is:

**"air force quit"**

Where:
- Before: "air force" (a nation's military planes)
- After: "force quit" (the key combination to exit frozen programs)
- Shared word: "force"
317 True ['Stevens'] In 2000, the Anchorage International Airport was renamed to honor **Senator Ted Stevens**. The airport's full name became the **Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport**, recognizing his long service as a U.S. senator from Alaska (1968–2009) and his significant contributions to the state's infrastructure and development.
318 False ['The Way Way Back'] The 2013 film you're referring to is **"The Way, Way Back"**.  

The title refers to the rear-facing third-row seat in a station wagon, specifically the 1970 Buick Estate Wagon featured in the movie. This seat is colloquially known as the "way back." The film follows a shy 14-year-old boy named Duncan who spends his summer vacation dealing with his mother's overbearing boyfriend while finding solace in a local water park.  

Great movie choice! Let me know if you'd like more details.
319 True ['fenugreek'] The leaves with a European nationality in their name that are essential to Iran's national dish **Ghormeh sabzi** are **fenugreek leaves** (known as *shanbalileh* in Persian).  

The word "fenugreek" comes from the Latin *foenum-graecum*, meaning "Greek hay," referencing its historical association with Greece. While fenugreek itself originates from the Mediterranean and Western Asia, its name carries a European (Greek) connection.  

In Ghormeh sabzi, fenugreek leaves contribute a slightly bitter, earthy flavor that is crucial to the dish's distinctive taste, along with other herbs like parsley, cilantro, and leeks.  

So, while no actual European leaves are used, **fenugreek** is the key herb with a European-linked name in this iconic Persian stew!
320 True ['Moldova'] The Danube nation south of Ukraine that became independent in 1991, slightly modified its name, and joined the U.N. the following year is **Moldova**.

Here’s the breakdown:
- **Independence**: Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union on **August 27, 1991**.
- **Name Change**: It was previously known as the **Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (MSSR)** but became the **Republic of Moldova** (or simply Moldova).
- **UN Membership**: Moldova joined the **United Nations on March 2, 1992**.

Moldova is located south of Ukraine and is bordered by the Danube River along part of its southwestern frontier (near the breakaway region of Transnistria and the Danube Delta). While the Danube does not flow through the heart of Moldova, it forms part of its border with Romania. 

If you were thinking of a country more directly on the Danube, **Romania** (which is also south of Ukraine) fits geographically but did not undergo a name change or gain independence in 1991 (it was already independent). Thus, Moldova is the correct answer given the criteria.
321 True ['Byrd'] The American explorer you're referring to is **Admiral Richard E. Byrd**. 

In 1934, Byrd spent five months alone in a small weather observation hut called **"Advance Base"** during the **Second Byrd Antarctic Expedition (1933–1935)**. He endured extreme cold, carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty stove, and severe frostbite. His condition deteriorated to the point that a rescue team had to retrieve him. 

Byrd's solitary winter-over became legendary in polar exploration history, and he later wrote about the experience in his book *"Alone"* (1938). Despite the ordeal, Byrd continued to lead expeditions to Antarctica and played a major role in early 20th-century polar exploration.
322 True ['Broca'] The area you're referring to is **Broca's area**, named after the 19th-century French pathologist **Paul Broca**. 

Broca's area is located in the **left frontal lobe** of the brain (typically in the **left inferior frontal gyrus**, encompassing parts of **Brodmann areas 44 and 45**). It plays a crucial role in **speech production and language processing**, particularly in the motor aspects of speech formation and grammar. 

Broca discovered this region's importance when studying patients with expressive aphasia (now called **Broca's aphasia**), who could understand language but had difficulty speaking fluently or forming grammatically correct sentences. 

Would you like more details on its function or related brain areas?
323 True ['Kim Philby'] Harry Lime, the charismatic and morally ambiguous villain of Graham Greene's *The Third Man* (1949), is widely believed to have been inspired by **Kim Philby**, one of the most notorious British spies and Soviet double agents of the 20th century.  

### Key Connections:  
1. **Graham Greene's Personal Ties** – Greene worked for MI6 during World War II and was acquainted with Philby, who later became infamous as a high-ranking Soviet mole within British intelligence (the "Cambridge Five").  
2. **Amoral Charm** – Like Harry Lime, Philby was charming, intelligent, and capable of ruthless betrayal, embodying the moral ambiguity Greene explored in the character.  
3. **Post-War Vienna Setting** – *The Third Man* is set in the espionage-riddled world of post-war Vienna, where Philby himself had operated as a spy.  

While Greene never explicitly confirmed Philby as the sole inspiration, the parallels—especially in their shared world of deception—are striking. Other possible influences include shady black-market figures Greene encountered in Vienna, but Philby remains the most compelling real-life counterpart.  

Would you like more details on Philby’s espionage career or Greene’s intelligence background?
324 True ['greenback'] The political party from the 1870s that got its colorful name due to its advocacy for maintaining or increasing paper money circulation was the **Greenback Party** (officially the **Greenback Labor Party**). 

The name "Greenback" referred to the paper currency (U.S. dollars) issued during and after the Civil War, which were not backed by gold but by the government's credit. The party opposed the return to the gold standard and sought to keep or expand the supply of paper money to help debtors, farmers, and workers by making credit more accessible and reducing deflationary pressures. 

The Greenback Party was particularly active in the late 1870s and early 1880s, merging some of its interests with the labor movement before fading as the silver-backed currency debate gained prominence.
325 True ['Nutmegger'] The answer is **"Nutmeggers."**  

Here's the breakdown:  
- **Connecticut** is nicknamed **"The Nutmeg State,"** and its residents are sometimes called **"Nutmeggers."**  
- The term references the spice **nutmeg**, which has historical ties to Connecticut (possibly due to early traders or a playful nod to the state's reputation for shrewdness).  
- Meanwhile, **"New Englanders"** is a broader term for residents of the six New England states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut).  

So, the playful riddle contrasts **Connecticuties** (a less common demonym) with **Nutmeggers**, highlighting the spice connection.  

*Bonus trivia:* Some claim the "nutmeg" nickname stems from Connecticut peddlers selling wooden nutmegs as real ones—though this is likely a myth!
326 True ['phlox'] The pink-colored flower ending in "x" that fits your description is likely **"phlox"** (specifically, varieties like *Phlox paniculata* or *Phlox subulata*, which can bloom in shades of pink).  

**Why phlox?**  
- **Ends with "x"**: The word "phlox" perfectly matches your clue.  
- **Pink varieties**: Many phlox species come in pink (e.g., *Pink Flame*, *Pink Attraction*).  
- **Poetic touch**: The phrase *"Picked them just for you"* hints at a playful, gift-like context, and phlox are popular garden flowers often used in bouquets.  

Other flowers ending in "x" (like *helianth*ox, a rare variant) are less common or not pink, making phlox the best fit.  

Would you like a poem or fun fact about phlox to go with your floral pick? 🌸
327 True ['Pictures at an Exhibition'] The work you're referring to is *Pictures at an Exhibition* by Modest Mussorgsky.  

This suite was composed in 1874 as a tribute to Mussorgsky's late friend, the artist and architect Viktor Hartmann, who had died the previous year. Each of the 10 movements (or "pictures") represents a different piece of Hartmann's artwork, which Mussorgsky had viewed at a posthumous exhibition. The movements are connected by a recurring "Promenade" theme, symbolizing the composer walking through the gallery.  

Some of the most famous movements include:  
- **"The Gnome"** (based on a sketch of a nutcracker)  
- **"The Old Castle"** (depicting a medieval troubadour)  
- **"Bydło"** (a Polish oxcart)  
- **"Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks"** (inspired by costume designs)  
- **"The Hut on Hen's Legs (Baba Yaga)"** (a clock in the shape of the witch's hut)  
- **"The Great Gate of Kiev"** (a grand architectural design)  

The suite was originally written for piano but is best known today in Maurice Ravel's brilliant orchestration.
328 True ['Dewey'] Earl Warren was the vice presidential running mate of **Thomas E. Dewey** in the **1948 U.S. presidential election**. 

Warren, then the popular Republican governor of California, joined Dewey's ticket, but they lost to the Democratic incumbent **Harry S. Truman** in a surprising upset. 

Five years later, in **1953**, Warren was appointed **Chief Justice of the United States** by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
329 True ['phrenology'] Franz Joseph Gall developed **phrenology**, a now-discredited pseudoscience that claimed to assess an individual's personality, character, and mental abilities by examining the shape and contours of their skull. 

Gall proposed that the brain was divided into distinct "organs," each responsible for different traits, and that the size of these organs could be inferred from bumps or depressions on the skull. Although phrenology gained popularity in the 19th century, it was later rejected due to a lack of scientific evidence and its reliance on subjective interpretations. Modern neuroscience has thoroughly discredited phrenology as a pseudoscience.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Milan Kundera's second novel, *Life is Elsewhere* (*Život je jinde*), was not allowed to be published in his home country at the time, **Czechoslovakia**, due to the political repression following the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. Kundera, who was living in Czechoslovakia when he wrote the novel, faced censorship under the Communist regime, which suppressed works critical of the government or deemed ideologically unacceptable. The novel was first published in France in 1973, after Kundera had emigrated. Kundera himself was later banned in Czechoslovakia, and his books were removed from libraries.
331 True ['Tulum'] The **Mayan Monkey Hostel** is located in **Playa del Carmen**, which is known as a trendy and vibrant destination in the Riviera Maya.  

- **Itza Hotel Akumal** is in **Akumal**, a quieter beach town famous for its sea turtles.  
- **Mayan Monkey Hostel** is in **Playa del Carmen**, a bustling hotspot with nightlife, shopping, and a lively atmosphere.  

So, the **'T'rendy place** is **Tulum** (another popular and trendy Riviera Maya destination), but in this case, the correct answer is **Playa del Carmen**—where Mayan Monkey Hostel is located.  

Would you like recommendations for other trendy hostels in the area? 😊
332 True ['Stefan Urquelle'] In season 5 of *Family Matters*, Jaleel White's character, Steve Urkel, takes an elixir and transforms into his suave alter ego, **Stefan Urquelle**. 

Stefan was the confident, smooth-talking version of Steve, who became a fan-favorite character due to his charm and charisma—quite the contrast to the nerdy and awkward Urkel. The transformation was a recurring gag in the show, often leading to humorous and romantic situations.
333 True ['Massachusetts'] Charles Sumner, the Free State senator who was brutally attacked on the Senate floor in 1856 by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks, was from **Massachusetts**. 

Sumner was a staunch abolitionist, and his fiery anti-slavery speech, "The Crime Against Kansas," provoked Brooks to assault him with a cane, nearly killing him. The attack further inflamed sectional tensions in the lead-up to the Civil War. Sumner later recovered and continued serving in the Senate for many years.
334 True ['Proulx'] The line **"The summer range lay above the tree line on the forest service land on Brokeback Mountain"** was written by **Annie Proulx** in her 1997 short story *"Brokeback Mountain."*  

The story was first published in *The New Yorker* and later included in Proulx's collection *Close Range: Wyoming Stories*. It gained widespread acclaim and was adapted into the 2005 Oscar-winning film *Brokeback Mountain*, directed by Ang Lee.  

Proulx's writing is known for its vivid descriptions of rural landscapes and complex character studies, and this line reflects her signature style.
335 True ['Winnebago'] You're thinking of **Lake Winnebago** in Wisconsin! It's the state's largest inland lake and home to **Madeline Island** (though Madeline Island is actually in Lake Superior, so let's clarify). 

For your RV adventure targeting **northern pike** and **largemouth bass**, **Lake Winnebago** is an excellent choice. It's renowned for its:  
- **Northern pike** (especially in weedy bays and drop-offs).  
- **Largemouth bass** (around docks, vegetation, and rocky structures).  

If you meant Wisconsin’s **largest island within a lake**, that would be **Madeline Island in Lake Superior** (part of the Apostle Islands), but it’s better known for smallmouth bass, lake trout, and walleye.  

For your described trip, **Lake Winnebago** is the perfect RV-friendly destination with great fishing, campgrounds, and access points. Tight lines! 🎣🚐  

*Bonus Tip:* Stop by **Sturgeon Spearing** hotspots in winter if you’re into unique angling traditions!
336 False ['Brancusi'] The Romanian sculptor you're referring to is **Constantin Brâncuși** (1876–1957). Beginning around **1908**, Brâncuși created several versions of *The Kiss* (*Le Baiser* in French), a seminal work in modern sculpture.  

These stone carvings depict an embracing couple in a highly simplified, almost abstract form, emphasizing the essence of love and unity rather than detailed realism. The first version (1907–1908) was created in Paris and marked a radical departure from traditional figurative sculpture. Brâncuși revisited the theme multiple times, producing variations in stone and other materials.  

His *Kiss* series is considered a foundational work of modernist sculpture, influencing later movements like Cubism and abstraction. One of the most famous versions is located at the **Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris**, serving as a tombstone for a young woman.  

Would you like details on specific versions or their locations?
337 True ['Boyhood'] Lorelei Linklater aged from 9 to 21 during the 12-year production of *Boyhood* (2014), directed by her father, **Richard Linklater**. The film was famously shot over a 12-year period to authentically capture the aging of its cast, including Lorelei, who played the protagonist's sister, Samantha.
338 True ['Crossing the Bar'] The poem you're referring to is **"Crossing the Bar"** by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  

The phrase **"crossing the bar"** has since become an idiom for dying, symbolizing the transition from life to death, much like a ship passing from a river into the open sea.  

The poem itself uses the metaphor of a sunset voyage to reflect on mortality, with the "bar" representing the boundary between life and the afterlife. Tennyson even requested that this poem be placed at the end of all editions of his works, serving as a fitting farewell.  

Would you like an excerpt or analysis of the poem?
339 True ['Bhutan'] The answer is **Bhutan**.  

Paro International Airport is one of the most challenging airports for manual landings due to its mountainous terrain and requires pilots to be specially certified. Bhutan, a Himalayan kingdom, has its capital in Thimphu, which is located near Paro. The country does not rely on radar for landings, and flights are only permitted during daylight hours under visual flight rules (VFR).  

Did you have a follow-up question about Bhutan or its aviation?
340 True ['Frankfurter'] The dual biography you're referring to covers **Louis Brandeis**, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, and **Felix Frankfurter**, the Vienna-born man who was the third Jewish Supreme Court Justice. 

- **Louis Brandeis** (appointed in 1916) was the first Jewish justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.  
- **Felix Frankfurter** (appointed in 1939) was the third Jewish justice (after Brandeis and Benjamin Cardozo) and was born in Vienna, Austria, before immigrating to the U.S. as a child.  

A well-known dual biography of these two influential justices is *"The Jewish Justices of the Supreme Court: From Brandeis to Kagan"* by David G. Dalin, which discusses their lives and legacies. Another relevant work is *"Louis D. Brandeis: A Life"* by Melvin Urofsky, which also touches on their relationship. 

Would you like recommendations for more books on this topic?
341 True ['atom'] In the early 1900s, the **"Plum Pudding" model** of the **atom** was replaced by the **planetary model** (also known as the **Rutherford model**). 

### Key Details:
1. **Plum Pudding Model (J.J. Thomson, 1904)**  
   - Proposed that atoms were composed of a positively charged "pudding" with negatively charged electrons embedded like "plums."  
   - Suggested a uniform distribution of charge.

2. **Planetary Model (Ernest Rutherford, 1911)**  
   - Resulted from the **gold foil experiment**, where alpha particles were scattered by a thin gold sheet.  
   - Showed that atoms have a tiny, dense, positively charged **nucleus** at the center, with electrons orbiting around it (like planets around the Sun).  
   - This disproved the Plum Pudding model, as some alpha particles were deflected at large angles, indicating a concentrated positive charge.

The Rutherford model was later refined by **Niels Bohr (1913)**, who introduced quantized electron orbits, leading to the **Bohr model**.
342 True ['Nikkei'] Japan's equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is called the **Nikkei 225**.  

The **Nikkei 225** is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 225 major publicly traded companies listed on the **Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)**. It is one of the most widely followed benchmarks for the Japanese stock market, similar to how the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)** represents the U.S. market.  

The index is maintained by **Nikkei Inc.** (formerly Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.), a leading financial media company in Japan.
343 True ['Aeschylus'] The actors in Jacques Rivette's *Out 1* (1971) rehearse *Seven Against Thebes*, a tragedy by the ancient Greek playwright **Aeschylus**. 

Aeschylus wrote the play in 467 BCE, and it is part of his Theban trilogy (though the other two plays, *Laius* and *Oedipus*, have been lost). *Seven Against Thebes* dramatizes the conflict between the sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynices, over the throne of Thebes. 

Rivette's use of this play within *Out 1* ties into the film's themes of conspiracy, performance, and fragmented narratives, as the actors' rehearsals mirror the elusive and labyrinthine structure of the film itself.
344 True ['connoisseur'] The 11-letter word you're looking for is **"connoisseur."**  

It means a lover or expert in the arts (or other refined fields) and comes from the Old French word *connoistre*, meaning "to know," which itself derives from the Latin *cognoscere* ("to become acquainted with").  

Fits perfectly with the clue!
345 True ['Mumbai'] The art school you're referring to stands in **Mumbai, India** (formerly known as Bombay), where **Rudyard Kipling was born on December 30, 1865**.  

The exact location is the **Sir J.J. School of Art**, which now occupies the site of **Kipling's birthplace** in the **J.J. Campus** near **D.N. Road in Fort, Mumbai**. A plaque once marked the spot, though the original building is no longer standing.  

Mumbai, now a bustling metropolis, was a major colonial city under British rule when Kipling was born there. His father, **John Lockwood Kipling**, was a professor at the school, which was founded in 1857 and remains one of India's premier art institutions.  

Would you like details on Kipling's early years in India or the history of the school?
346 True ['The Little Foxes'] The Lillian Hellman drama you're referring to is *"The Little Foxes"* (1939).  

This play explores themes of greed, ambition, and moral corruption within a wealthy Southern family, the Hubbards, as they scheme to secure a business deal that will make them even richer—regardless of the ethical cost. The title is derived from a line in the *Song of Solomon* (2:15) in the Bible: *"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines."* Hellman uses this metaphor to critique the destructive nature of unchecked greed.  

The ruthless Regina Hubbard Giddens and her brothers, Ben and Oscar, manipulate and betray each other in their pursuit of wealth, making *The Little Foxes* a sharp critique of capitalism and familial exploitation.  

Would you like more details on the plot or characters?
347 False ['Histrionic'] The 1932 article you're referencing highlights Franklin D. Roosevelt's **"unexpected radio ability"**—his skill as a compelling and effective communicator over the radio, which would later become a hallmark of his presidency with his famous **"Fireside Chats."** 

The observation that *"The dramatic is not without value in politics"* underscores how Roosevelt's charismatic and accessible broadcasting style helped him connect with the American public during the Great Depression, fostering trust and confidence. This ability to use media (then, primarily radio) in a personal, dramatic way was innovative for its time and proved crucial to his political success. 

Would you like more details on how FDR's radio presence shaped his presidency?
348 True ['Kafka'] The future author of unsettling tales who became a man at his Bar Mitzvah on June 13, 1896, in Prague was **Franz Kafka**. 

Kafka, born on July 3, 1883, is renowned for his deeply existential and often unsettling works, such as *The Metamorphosis*, *The Trial*, and *The Castle*. His writing explores themes of alienation, absurdity, and bureaucratic oppression, leaving a profound impact on 20th-century literature. The Bar Mitzvah marked his formal entry into Jewish adulthood, an event that occurred in the culturally rich but complex environment of Prague's Jewish community at the time.
349 True ['Maxwell'] The character who uses his "Silver Hammer" to take out Joan, a school teacher, and the judge is **Maxwell Edison** from The Beatles' song **"Maxwell's Silver Hammer"** on their 1969 album *Abbey Road*.  

Written by Paul McCartney, the song is a darkly humorous tale about Maxwell, a seemingly cheerful medical student who commits murders with his silver hammer. The victims include:  
- **Joan** (a quizzical girl he meets in a dance hall)  
- **His teacher** (annoyed by Maxwell's tardiness)  
- **The judge** (at his trial)  

The song contrasts its upbeat melody with its macabre subject matter, a classic example of The Beatles' playful storytelling.
350 True ['Morgan'] Let’s raise a glass to **Captain Sir Henry Morgan**, the legendary Welsh buccaneer who became Deputy Governor of Jamaica in 1674!  

Morgan was one of the most infamous privateers of the Caribbean, leading daring raids against Spanish settlements (like the sack of Panama in 1671). Despite his piratical reputation, he was knighted by King Charles II and later appointed to govern Jamaica—where he surprisingly cracked down on piracy.  

His name lives on in the famous **Captain Morgan** rum brand, making him the perfect toast for your question. Cheers! 🍹🏴‍☠️
351 True ['Lincoln'] April 15th is the date of **Abraham Lincoln's death** (he was assassinated on April 14, 1865, and died the following morning). Lincoln's portrait appears on the U.S. **$5 bill** and the **penny (1¢ coin)**. 

If you're referring to another figure featured on currency who died on April 15th, one notable example is **Leonardo da Vinci** (died April 15, 1519), who appears on older Italian lire and some commemorative euro coins. However, Lincoln is the most prominent figure associated with that date in the context of widely circulated currency. 

Let me know if you were thinking of someone else!
352 True ['Maurier'] The scary story *"The Birds"* was written by **Daphne du Maurier**. Her 1952 novelette became the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1963 horror-thriller film of the same name. While Hitchcock's adaptation differs in some details (changing the setting from England to California and altering characters), it retains the terrifying premise of birds suddenly and inexplicably attacking humans.  

Would you like details on the differences between the story and the film?
353 True ['Haydn'] The music of Germany's national anthem, *"Das Lied der Deutschen"* (The Song of the Germans), was composed by the **Austrian composer Joseph Haydn** in 1797. 

Haydn originally wrote the melody as *"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser"* (God Save Emperor Francis) for the birthday of **Emperor Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire**. The tune later became known as the *"Emperor's Hymn"* (*Kaiserhymne*). 

In 1922, the melody was adopted for Germany's national anthem with lyrics by **August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben**, written in 1841. Today, only the third stanza of the original poem is used as the official anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany.
354 True ['Endorphins'] A hug releases **endorphins**—feel-good hormones named in part for their similarity to **morphine** (a narcotic). The word "endorphin" comes from "endogenous morphine."  

So go give that hug! It’s a natural mood booster. 😊
355 True ['Polley'] The Canadian filmmaker who not only acted in but also wrote and directed *Women Talking* (2022) is **Sarah Polley**. 

Polley adapted the screenplay from Miriam Toews' novel of the same name and directed the film, which received critical acclaim, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. While she did not act in *Women Talking*, she is known for her earlier work as an actor in films like *The Sweet Hereafter* (1997) and *Dawn of the Dead* (2004) before transitioning into writing and directing. 

If you were thinking of someone who acted in the film, the cast includes Canadian actors like **Sheila McCarthy** and **Michelle McLeod**, but Polley was solely the writer-director for this project.
356 True ['occlusion'] The medical term you're referring to is **"thrombosis"** when caused by a blood clot (thrombus) or **"embolism"** when the obstruction is due to a traveling clot or other material (embolus). 

- **Thrombosis**: The formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel, obstructing blood flow.  
- **Embolism**: The blockage of a vessel by an embolus (e.g., a clot, air bubble, fat, or other debris) that travels from another part of the body.  

If the obstruction occurs in an **artery**, it is called **arterial thrombosis** or **arterial embolism**, leading to conditions like:  
- **Myocardial infarction** (heart attack) if in a coronary artery.  
- **Stroke** if in a cerebral artery.  
- **Peripheral artery occlusion** if in a limb.
