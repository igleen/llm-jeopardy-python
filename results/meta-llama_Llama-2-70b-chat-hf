0 True ['Bogart'] The last name starting with 'B' of an uber-cool Hollywood icon that is also a verb meaning to hog something is "Bogart." The verb "bogart" means to hog or monopolize something, which is not cool.

Humphrey Bogart was a legendary actor known for his iconic roles in movies like "Casablanca," "The Maltese Falcon," and "The African Queen." He was known for his tough, no-nonsense screen persona and his ability to deliver memorable lines with style and grace. However, the verb "bogart" has a different connotation, implying that someone is taking more than their fair share or hogging the spotlight, which is not in line with Bogart's cool and humble image.
1 True ['Fiji'] The south Pacific country that fits this description is Fiji. Fiji has a total of 332 islands, but the majority of its population, around 70%, lives on its largest island, Viti Levu. Viti Levu is home to the capital city of Suva, as well as many other major towns and cities, and is the economic and political hub of the country.
2 False ['Calder'] As an artist, I believe that art should not be limited to static forms. The next step in sculpture is motion, and I'm not just talking about kinetic art that moves on its own. I'm talking about art that invites the viewer to engage with it, to become a part of it.

Imagine walking through a museum and coming across a sculpture that doesn't just sit there, looking pretty. Instead, it moves, it changes, it responds to your presence. It's like a living, breathing creature, and you can't help but feel a connection to it.

That's what I want to create. I want to blur the lines between art and viewer, between object and experience. I want my art to be a catalyst for imagination, a spark that sets off a chain reaction of creativity and engagement.

And I'm not just talking about technology, although that's certainly a part of it. I'm talking about creating art that has a life of its own, that evolves and changes over time. Art that is dynamic, that invites participation, that inspires the viewer to become a co-creator.

For too long, art has been stuck in a rut, relying on the same old forms and techniques. It's time to shake things up, to push the boundaries of what we think art can be. It's time to make art that moves, that inspires, that challenges our perceptions and engages our imaginations.

So, why must art be static? Because we've been conditioned to think that that's what art should be. But I say, let's break free from those constraints and create art that is alive, art that moves and breathes and inspires. The next step in sculpture is motion, and I'm excited to be a part of that journey.
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] In medieval alchemy, the substance believed to have the power to transform base metals into gold was called the "Philosopher's Stone" or "Tincture." The concept of the Philosopher's Stone originated in ancient Greece and was later developed by alchemists in the Middle Ages.

The Philosopher's Stone was believed to be a mysterious substance that could transform base metals like lead or copper into gold, as well as confer eternal life and spiritual enlightenment upon those who possessed it. Alchemists spent centuries trying to create the Philosopher's Stone, using various methods and substances in their attempts.

One of the most famous recipes for creating the Philosopher's Stone involved a substance called "quicksilver," which is the alchemical name for mercury. Alchemists believed that by combining mercury with other substances, such as sulfur and silver, they could create the Philosopher's Stone.

It's worth noting that the idea of the Philosopher's Stone and the practice of alchemy were not limited to the medieval period. Alchemy continued to evolve and was practiced well into the Renaissance and beyond, with some alchemists continuing to search for the elusive Philosopher's Stone.

In the Harry Potter universe, it's possible that the character of Nicholas Flamel, who is said to have created the Philosopher's Stone, might have used a similar substance or method to achieve his goal. However, it's important to note that the Philosopher's Stone in the Harry Potter universe is not necessarily the same as the one from medieval alchemy, and its properties and origins are left largely to the imagination of J.K. Rowling.
4 True ['Leontyne Price'] The self-titled 1961 L.P. of arias sung by American woman great 'L.P.' known to opera lovers as the 'Blue Album' is none other than the album "Leontyne Price Sings Verdi" by Leontyne Price.

The album includes a selection of arias by Giuseppe Verdi, one of the most famous opera composers of all time, and it showcases Price's stunning vocal talent and interpretive skills.

This idiom can also be used in a broader sense to describe removing obstacles or difficulties for someone else, allowing them to progress or achieve their goals more easily.
12 True ['Virginia Woolf'] The woman whose story was illustrated by her sister Vanessa Bell is Virginia Woolf. Virginia Woolf was a British author, essayist, and feminist who was a key figure in the modernist movement in literature. She was also a member of the Bloomsbury Group, a circle of intellectuals and artists that included her sister Vanessa Bell, who was a painter and designer.

Vanessa Bell illustrated the cover of Virginia Woolf's book "Kew Gardens," which was published in 1919. The book is a short story that explores the inner lives of a group of people visiting Kew Gardens, a botanical garden in London. The story is known for its stream-of-consciousness style and its exploration of themes such as gender, class, and the relationship between humans and nature.

Vanessa Bell's illustrations for the book cover feature a stylized depiction of a garden, with flowers and trees rendered in bold, abstract shapes and colors. The illustrations reflect the modernist aesthetic of the Bloomsbury Group and complement the experimental style of Woolf's writing.

Overall, the collaboration between Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell on "Kew Gardens" is an example of the creative partnerships and exchange of ideas that were a hallmark of the Bloomsbury Group, and it remains a significant work in the history of modernist literature and art.
13 True ['Fait Accompli'] The two-word situation in French for "concluded fact" is "fait accompli."

"Fait" means "fact" or "deed," and "accompli" means "completed" or "finished." Together, "fait accompli" means a situation that has already been decided or settled, and cannot be changed or undone.

Here are a few examples of how you might use "fait accompli" in a sentence:

* Le divorce est un fait accompli. (The divorce is a done deal.)
* La décision est prise, c'est un fait accompli. (The decision has been made, it's a done deal.)
* Le projet est terminé, c'est un fait accompli. (The project is finished, it's a done deal.)

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
14 True ['Arsenic'] Before penicillin, salvarsan, a compound of arsenic, was used to treat syphilis. Salvarsan, also known as arsphenamine, was developed in 1907 by the German physician and chemist Paul Ehrlich. It was the first effective treatment for syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum.

Salvarsan was a significant improvement over previous treatments for syphilis, which included mercury and other heavy metals. These treatments were often ineffective and had severe side effects. Salvarsan, on the other hand, was relatively effective and had fewer side effects. It worked by interfering with the growth of the bacteria that caused syphilis, allowing the body's immune system to fight off the infection.

Although salvarsan was a major breakthrough in the treatment of syphilis, it was not without its drawbacks. It was expensive, difficult to produce, and had a bitter, unpleasant taste. In addition, it was not always effective, and some patients experienced a relapse after treatment.

Despite these limitations, salvarsan remained the primary treatment for syphilis until the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s. Penicillin was a more effective and less toxic treatment for syphilis, and it quickly replaced salvarsan as the standard treatment for the disease. Today, salvarsan is no longer used to treat syphilis, but it remains an important part of medical history as a pioneering example of the use of chemical compounds to treat bacterial infections.
15 True ['Jon Batiste'] The answer to your question is Jon Batiste.

Jon Batiste is a New Orleans-based pianist, singer, and songwriter who has been the bandleader for "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" since 2015. In 2021, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his work on the film "Soul," which was directed by Pixar's Pete Docter.

In addition to his work on "Soul," Batiste also released a new album in 2021 titled "We Are," which features a blend of jazz, funk, and soul music. He has continued to balance his work as a film composer and bandleader with his day job leading the house band on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."
16 True ['Customs'] The Apollo 11 astronauts had to declare the Moon rocks they brought back to Earth to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

After the Apollo 11 mission, the astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, returned to Earth on July 24, 1969. When they arrived, they were greeted by a CBP officer who asked them to declare the items they had brought back from the Moon.

The astronauts had brought back a total of 48 pounds (21.8 kilograms) of Moon rocks and soil, which were placed in a special container and declared to the CBP officer. The declaration process was a standard procedure for any item brought back to Earth from space, and it was done to ensure that the Moon rocks were properly documented and accounted for.

The Moon rocks were later transferred to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where they were studied by scientists and are now preserved for future generations.
17 True ['O. Henry'] The author of "The Gift of the Magi" who spent time in prison for embezzlement was O. Henry (real name William Sydney Porter).

18 True ['Byzantine'] The era of art in the Eastern Roman Empire that featured mosaics as a major art form was the Byzantine period, which lasted from the 4th to the 15th century (400-1400 AD).

The use of mosaics reached its peak during the Justinian period (527-565 AD), when the Emperor Justinian commissioned many large-scale mosaic projects, including the famous Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The use of mosaics continued throughout the Byzantine period, but it declined after the fall of Constantinople in 1204 AD.
19 True ['Ethiopia'] Hubert Julian, also known as the "Black Eagle," was a Trinidadian-American aviator, skydiver, and musician who gained fame for his daring stunts and his advocacy for African American rights. In the 1930s, Julian traveled to Ethiopia to support Emperor Haile Selassie's resistance against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.

Julian was born in Trinidad in 1897 and moved to the United States as a young man. He became a skydiver and aviator, and was known for his daring stunts, such as jumping out of airplanes while playing his saxophone. He also became a prominent figure in the African American community, advocating for civil rights and promoting Pan-Africanism.

In 1935, Julian traveled to Ethiopia to support Emperor Haile Selassie's resistance against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Italy had invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and the emperor had appealed to the international community for support. Julian saw this as an opportunity to support the Ethiopian people and to promote Pan-Africanism.

Julian joined the Ethiopian air force and became a pilot, flying missions against the Italian army. He also used his saxophone to entertain the soldiers and to boost morale. Despite his efforts, the Ethiopian army was ultimately defeated by the Italians, and Haile Selassie was forced into exile.

Julian's experiences in Ethiopia had a profound impact on his life and his beliefs. He became even more committed to the cause of Pan-Africanism and to the fight against colonialism and racism. He continued to perform and advocate for African American rights, and he became a prominent figure in the African American community.

Julian's legacy is still celebrated today, both for his daring stunts and his advocacy for African American rights. He is remembered as a pioneering figure in the struggle for racial equality and as a symbol of African American pride and determination.

They are the largest arboreal animals in the world and are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and distinctive red hair.
28 True ['Abide With Me'] In the hymn "Abide with Me" by Henry Francis Lyte, the lines you're referring to are:

"Fast falls the eventide,
The shadows deepen, Lord, with Thee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me."

The phrase "fast falls the eventide" suggests that night is falling quickly, and the shadows are deepening. The speaker is asking for God's presence and guidance in the face of the approaching darkness and the uncertainty of life and death. The line "In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me" is a request for God's presence and comfort throughout all of life, including in times of death and dying. The speaker is asking for God's abiding presence, guidance, and comfort in all of life's experiences.

According to the legend, Constantine had a vision of a cross before the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD, in which he was told that he would conquer his enemies under the symbol of the cross.

The story is recorded in the works of the Christian historian Eusebius, who wrote in the 4th century. According to Eusebius, Constantine had a vision of a cross in the sky, accompanied by the words "Ἐν τούτῳ νίκα" (in Latin, "In hoc signo vinces"), which means "By this sign, you will conquer." Constantine took the vision as a sign from God that he would be victorious in the upcoming battle, and he ordered his soldiers to paint the symbol of the cross on their shields.

The story of Constantine's vision has been passed down through the centuries and has become a famous example of the intersection of Christianity and politics. However, it is worth noting that some historians question the accuracy of the story, and there is ongoing debate about the details of the event and its significance.

It's important to note that the use of anthrax or any other disease as a weapon is illegal and unethical, and it can have devastating consequences for human health and safety. It's important to rely on accurate information and avoid spreading misinformation or perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide you with helpful and accurate information.

51 True ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] The answer to your first question is "upswing." An upswing is a period during which business is at a high point, characterized by economic growth, increased demand for goods and services, and a general sense of prosperity.

The answer to your second question is "upcycling." Upcycling is the process of using discarded or waste materials to create new products of higher value or quality. It is a form of recycling that focuses on transforming waste into something useful and valuable, rather than simply reusing or reprocessing it. Upcycling is often associated with sustainability and environmentalism, as it reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and conserves resources by using materials that would otherwise be thrown away.
52 True ['Lisbon'] King Carlos I and his son, Luis Filipe, were assassinated in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, on February 1, 1908. The assassination was carried out by a group of republican activists who were seeking to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic in Portugal.

54 True ['Inigo Jones'] The answer to your question is Inigo Jones.

Inigo Jones was a British architect who is considered one of the most important figures in the development of English architecture. He was born in 1573 and died in 1652. Jones was the first English architect to employ the classical style, which he had learned during his travels in Italy.

In 1616, Jones began work on the Queen's House in Greenwich, London, which is considered to be England's first classical building. The Queen's House was built for Queen Anne, the wife of King James I, and it was designed in the style of the Italian Renaissance. The building's design was influenced by the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, and it features a central domed rotunda surrounded by four wings.

Jones' work on the Queen's House marked the beginning of a new era in English architecture, as it introduced the classical style to the country and paved the way for the development of the English Baroque style. Jones went on to design many other important buildings in England, including the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London, which was completed in 1622.
55 True ['Revolutionary Road'] The novel you're referring to is "Revolutionary Road" by Richard Yates. The title of the novel is meant to suggest that the revolutionary spirit and ideals of 1776, which represented a desire for freedom and change, had by the 1950s become stifled and lost their way. The novel explores the lives of a group of people living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the 1950s, who are struggling to find meaning and purpose in their lives, and feels suffocated by the conformity and materialism of the time. The title implies that the promise and ideals of the American Revolution have not been realized in the lives of these characters, and that they are instead trapped in a society that values conformity and material success over individual freedom and fulfillment.
56 True ['medulla oblongata'] The lowest part of the brain stem is called the "medulla oblongata."
57 True ['Kool Herc'] The name of the mythical strongman that Clive Campbell used for his DJ name was "Kool Herc." Clive Campbell, also known as DJ Kool Herc, is widely considered the "founding father of hip-hop" and is credited with throwing the first hip-hop party on August 11, 1973, in the Bronx, New York. The party was held in a recreation room of a housing project and featured Campbell's innovative DJing style, which involved extending the breaks in funk and soul records to create a continuous flow of music that allowed people to dance for longer periods of time. This style of DJing, along with other elements such as MCing (rapping) and breakdancing, would go on to become the foundation of the hip-hop culture.
58 False ['Cuspidor'] Sure! "Crisp Duo" can be anagrammed into "Spittingly".

61 True ['Perdition'] The film you're referring to is likely "The Road to Perdition" (2002), which stars Tom Hanks as Michael Sullivan. The title "Perdition" refers to a state of spiritual loss or ruin, and the film's storyline explores themes of sin, guilt, and redemption.

In the film, Michael Sullivan is a hitman working for an Irish mobster during the Great Depression. After his son witnesses one of his hits, Sullivan is forced to take his son on the road to avoid being killed by his employer. Along the way, Sullivan grapples with his own moral failings and the legacy of violence he's created, leading him to question his own spiritual values and seek a path towards redemption.

The film's title, "The Road to Perdition," is a reference to the classic novel by John Steinbeck, "The Grapes of Wrath," in which the character Tom Joad says, "I'm just a-goin' down the road to perdition, an' I ain't a-gonna stop." In both works, the concept of "perdition" represents a spiritual state of damnation or ruin, and the characters' journeys are about confronting their own moral failings and seeking redemption.

68 True ['Tuvalu'] The former Ellice Islands are now Tuvalu, a small island nation located in the Pacific Ocean. Tuvalu derives a substantial part of its revenue from leasing the .tv domain name, which is popular among television and media companies due to its similarity to the abbreviation for television. The country has been leasing the domain name since the 1990s and it has become a significant source of income for the government.
69 True ['Trepanning', 'trepanation', 'trephination', 'trephining'] The earlier medical procedure you are referring to is called trephination, also known as trepanation. It is an ancient surgical technique that involves drilling a hole in the skull to release pressure or evil spirits. The procedure was used to treat various conditions, including head injuries, seizures, and mental illness.

Trepanation has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The procedure was believed to help relieve pressure on the brain, reduce pain, and even cure mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. In some cultures, trepanation was also believed to release evil spirits or demons that were thought to possess the patient.

Trepanation was performed using a variety of tools, including augers, drills, and saws. The procedure was often performed without anesthesia, and the patient was typically restrained to prevent them from moving during the procedure.

While trepanation was widely used in the past, it has largely been replaced by modern surgical techniques and is no longer considered a valid medical practice. However, some modern medical procedures, such as craniotomy, still involve drilling holes in the skull to relieve pressure or access the brain for surgical purposes.
70 True ['Templar'] The Knights Templar were a military order of monks who were founded in the early 12th century to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. They were known for their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, and they were highly respected and influential throughout Europe.

In 1307, King Philip IV of France, who was deeply in debt to the Knights Templar, accused them of heresy and launched a campaign against them. Many of the Knights Templar were arrested, tortured, and tried in Paris for heresy. In 1310, a number of them were burned at the stake in Paris, including the Grand Master of the Order, Jacques de Molay.

The charges against the Knights Templar included allegations of blasphemy, heresy, and sodomy. They were also accused of worshiping a false idol, known as the "Baphomet," and of engaging in secret rituals and initiations. Many of these charges were likely fabricated, and the trial was widely seen as a political move by King Philip to eliminate his debt and gain control of the Knights Templar's wealth and power.

The suppression of the Knights Templar was a significant event in medieval history, and it marked the beginning of a period of decline for the order. The remaining Knights Templar were either imprisoned or forced to flee, and their assets were seized by the church and the state. The order was eventually disbanded in 1312 by Pope Clement V, and its members were either absorbed into other religious orders or disappeared into obscurity.

78 True ['Groundlings'] If I were part of an "Earthy" group taking in a play at the Globe Theater during Shakespeare's time, I would have paid the lowest amount to stand in the pit and watch the play. The pit was the area in front of the stage where the common people, known as the "groundlings," stood to watch the play. The groundlings were the lowest-paying audience members and were often made up of laborers, apprentices, and other working-class individuals. They paid a small fee, usually a penny or two, to stand in the pit and watch the play. In contrast, the wealthier audience members sat in the galleries above the pit, where they could pay a higher price for a more comfortable and elevated viewing experience.

85 True ['Quiet Desperation'] In "Walden," Thoreau wrote, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." This phrase has become one of the most famous and often-quoted lines from the book, and it reflects Thoreau's belief that many people live unhappy and unfulfilling lives, trapped in a cycle of conformity and materialism.
86 True ['Marlow'] The book character you're referring to is Marlow, from Joseph Conrad's novella "Heart of Darkness." Marlow is a sailor who travels up the Congo River into the heart of Africa, where he encounters the infamous and enigmatic ivory trader, Kurtz. As Marlow journeys deeper into the jungle, he witnesses the brutality and exploitation of the African natives by European colonizers, which leads him to question the morality and values of Western civilization.

In the book, Marlow hears rumors about Kurtz's terrible deeds, which are referred to as "the horror" or "the darkness." He becomes obsessed with meeting Kurtz and uncovering the truth about his activities. When he finally meets Kurtz, he is shocked by the extent of his depravity and the depth of his corruption. The encounter has a profound effect on Marlow, who returns to Europe a changed man, haunted by the memories of what he witnessed in the Congo.

"Heart of Darkness" is a classic of 20th-century literature and is widely studied for its exploration of themes such as colonialism, imperialism, and the human condition. However, it has also been criticized for its portrayal of African people and its use of racist language, which some argue perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to systemic racism.
87 True ['Gallium'] The element you are referring to is Gallium, symbol Ga, a metal with a low melting point. Gallium is a soft, silvery-blue metal that melts at around 29.76°C (85.57°F), making it one of the few elements that can melt at or near room temperature.

Gallium has been used in various applications, including the development of shape-memory alloys (SMAs) and shape-shifting materials, due to its unique properties. Shape-memory alloys are materials that can change their shape in response to temperature changes and can return to their original shape when heated or cooled.

The idea of creating a mini robot that can shape-shift like the T-1000, a fictional robot from the Terminator franchise, using gallium or a gallium-based alloy is interesting. However, it is important to note that the development of such a robot would require significant advancements in materials science, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Currently, there are some robots that can change their shape or adapt to different environments, but they are not yet at the level of sophistication depicted in science fiction. Nevertheless, researchers continue to explore the potential of gallium and other shape-memory materials in robotics and other applications, and it is possible that we may see advancements in this area in the future.

89 True ['Justinian'] The 6th century outbreak of Bubonic Plague that nearly killed a Byzantine Emperor and devastated his empire is known as the "Plague of Justinian." It occurred during the reign of Emperor Justinian I, who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 527 to 565 AD. The plague, which was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, broke out in 541 AD and lasted for several years, causing widespread death and destruction throughout the empire. It is estimated that the plague killed up to 25 million people, or approximately 40% of the empire's population. The plague had a significant impact on the empire's economy, society, and politics, and is considered one of the most significant pandemics in human history.
90 True ['Pensacola'] In 1559, a Spanish expedition settled for about 2 years at what is today Pensacola, Florida, near the western end of the Panhandle. The expedition was led by Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano and established a settlement called Presidio de Panzacola. The settlement was eventually abandoned due to supply issues, conflicts with local Native American tribes, and a devastating hurricane that hit the area in 1561. However, the expedition marked the first European settlement in what is now the United States, predating the English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia by more than 40 years.
91 True ['Avogadro'] The Italian scientist you are referring to is Amedeo Avogadro, and the law you are describing is known as Avogadro's Law. It states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of molecules.

Avogadro's Law is a fundamental principle in chemistry and physics that helps to explain the behavior of ideal gases. It was first proposed by Avogadro in 1811 and later became a fundamental principle in the kinetic theory of gases.

The law can be stated mathematically as:

V1 = V2
P1 = P2
T1 = T2

where V1 and V2 are the volumes of two samples of gas, P1 and P2 are the pressures, and T1 and T2 are the temperatures.

This law has important implications for the study of gas laws and the behavior of gases, as it allows scientists to make predictions about the behavior of gases under different conditions.
92 True ['Tequila'] The song you're thinking of is "Tequila" by The Champs. It was released in 1958 and features a prominent saxophone riff and a catchy, repetitive melody. The song's only lyric is the title word, "Tequila!" shouted by the band's saxophonist, Danny Flores.

"Married" was published in 1884 and it was a collection of short stories that explored themes of marriage, relationships, and social conventions. The book was controversial at the time, as it challenged traditional values and norms, and it was considered blasphemous by some critics.

Strindberg was accused of blasphemy and was put on trial in 1885. He was found guilty and sentenced to a fine, but the sentence was later appealed and he was acquitted. Despite the controversy, "Married" is now considered a classic of Swedish literature and is still widely read and studied today.
94 False ['Freebooter'] The name "Blackbeak" doesn't contain any reference to a type of shoe. "Blackbeak" is a name that suggests a pirate with a long, black beard, rather than a specific type of footwear.

If you're looking for a pirate-themed name that includes a reference to a type of shoe, you might consider something like "Booty McBoots" or "Sole Searcher." These names incorporate pirate-themed elements (treasure and sailing, respectively) and also reference footwear.
95 True ['Bhutan'] The world's highest unclimbed mountain is Gangkhar Puensum, which is located in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, also known as the "Thunder Dragon" Kingdom.

He is also known for his work on the concept of electrical circuits and the discovery of the fundamental laws of electromagnetism.
98 True ['Sphynx'] The hairless breed of cat that got its start in Canada in the 20th century with a kitten named Prune is the Sphynx. Prune was born in 1966 to a black and white domestic shorthair mother and a Devon Rex father, and she was the first known hairless cat. She was bred by a Canadian breeder named Shirley Smith, who developed the Sphynx breed through selective breeding of cats with a natural mutation that caused them to be born without fur. Today, the Sphynx is a popular breed known for its sleek, muscular body and affectionate personality.
99 False ['Vorpal Sword'] In Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, Alice does not slay the Jabberwocky. The Jabberwocky is not even in the 2010 film. The Jabberwocky is a character in Lewis Carroll's original book, Through the Looking-Glass, and its only appearance in the 2010 film is as a stuffed animal in the Bandersnatch's lair. 

In the book, Alice does not slay the Jabberwocky either. The Jabberwocky is already dead when Alice arrives in the story, and the Hatter and the Hare explain to Alice that the Jabberwocky was killed by the White Queen's guards.

In the book, the Jabberwocky is described as being killed "with its gyves", which are iron bars used to restrain it. The Jabberwocky is also described as having "jaws that bite, claws that catch", which suggests that it was a fierce and dangerous creature.

In summary, Alice does not slay the Jabberwocky in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, nor does she in Lewis Carroll's original book. The Jabberwocky is already dead when Alice arrives in the story, and it was killed by the White Queen's guards.
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome is credited with the translation of the Bible into Latin, specifically the Vulgate, which was completed around 405. The Vulgate is a translation of the Bible into Latin, and it is considered one of the most important translations of the Bible in the history of Christianity.

105 False ['Ha Ha'] Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, had a sunk fence at Monticello, his estate in Virginia. The fence was designed to separate the animal territory from the human territory, and it was known as a "ha-ha."

A ha-ha is a type of fence that is sunken into the ground, typically several feet deep, and is designed to be invisible from a distance. The name "ha-ha" is thought to come from the French phrase "aha," which means "aha" or "oh, I see," as it was a clever way to keep animals out of the garden without obstructing the view.

Jefferson's ha-ha at Monticello was a sophisticated example of this type of fence, and it was designed to keep livestock out of his garden and orchard. The ha-ha was constructed with a stone wall at the bottom, and the earth was banked up on either side to create a sloping trench. The fence was topped with a wooden rail, and it was virtually invisible from a distance, allowing Jefferson to enjoy the unobstructed view of his gardens and the surrounding countryside.

The ha-ha at Monticello is still standing today, and it is a testament to Jefferson's ingenuity and his commitment to creating a beautiful and functional landscape.
106 True ['Venerate'] The word you're looking for is "venerate." It comes from the Latin word "venerari," which means "to love" or "to reverence." To venerate something or someone is to hold them in high esteem, to respect them deeply, or to worship them.
107 True ['Flagella', 'Flagellum', 'Flagellin'] The parts of a bacteria cell that provide motility are called flagella. Flagella are long, whip-like structures that are powered by the cell's motor proteins, which use chemical energy to rotate the flagella and propel the cell forward. Flagella are typically longer than cilia, ranging in length from a few micrometers to tens of micrometers, depending on the species of bacteria.

Flagella are made up of three main parts: the flagellum, the hook, and the motor. The flagellum is the long, helical structure that extends from the cell surface. The hook is a short, flexible segment that connects the flagellum to the motor. The motor is a complex of proteins that uses chemical energy to rotate the flagellum and drive the movement of the cell.

The motor proteins that drive flagellar motion are called FliI, FliJ, and FliN. These proteins work together to generate a torque that causes the flagellum to rotate. The rotation of the flagellum creates a force that propels the cell forward. The direction of movement is determined by the direction of flagellar rotation, which can be controlled by the cell's signaling pathways.

In addition to providing motility, flagella also play a role in other cellular processes, such as chemotaxis, the ability of cells to move towards or away from chemicals in their environment. Flagella are also involved in the formation of biofilms, which are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and produce extracellular matrix materials.

Overall, flagella are an important feature of many bacteria, and play a crucial role in their ability to move and interact with their environment.

Basilone served in the Philippines in the 1930s as a member of the U.S. Army, and his nickname likely referred to his time spent in the city of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
110 True ['Io'] The magnificent infrared shot of a moon of Jupiter aglow with volcanoes was taken by the Juno spacecraft in 2022, but it was not of Io, as I previously stated. The image was actually taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, which imaged the moon of Jupiter, Europa, on March 14, 2022. Europa is thought to have a subsurface ocean and is considered a prime target for future space missions searching for life beyond Earth.

The image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope shows Europa's icy surface and the faint glow of its subsurface ocean, which is believed to be heated by tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. The image also reveals the moon's surface features, including ridges, cracks, and craters.

I apologize for my mistake earlier and hope this clears up any confusion. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
111 True ['NewsRadio'] Phil Hartman played the role of Bill McNeal on the 1990s sitcom "NewsRadio." The show aired from 1995 to 1999 and starred Hartman as the egotistical and eccentric news anchor for the fictional radio station WNYX.

120 True ['Francis Bacon'] The 17th century Essayist who was the Lord Chancellor of England with the same first and last name as the 20th century painter of 'Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)' is Francis Bacon.

Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St. Alban, was an English philosopher, statesman, scientist, lawyer, orator, and author who lived from 1561 to 1626. He was created Viscount St. Alban in 1621 and served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1617 to 1621. Bacon was a prominent figure in the scientific revolution and is known for his works on philosophy, legal reform, and his advocacy for inductive methodologies.

Francis Bacon, on the other hand, was a 20th-century Irish-born British painter who lived from 1909 to 1992. He is best known for his bold, figurative paintings, often depicting isolated and twisted human figures. One of his most famous works is 'Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)', which he painted in 1952.

Although they share the same first and last name, there is no direct relationship between the two Francis Bacons. The painter Francis Bacon was named after his famous ancestor, but they lived in different times and had different careers.
121 True ['Calypso'] The nymph who shares her name with a music style and welcomes Odysseus' son Telemachus is Calypso. Calypso is a sea nymph who lives on the island of Ogygia, and she is known for her beauty and her ability to charm and seduce mortals. In Homer's "Odyssey," Calypso falls in love with Odysseus and keeps him on her island for seven years, promising him immortality if he stays with her. However, Odysseus longs to return to his home and wife, Penelope, and eventually convinces Calypso to let him go.

Angelica Kauffmann, a Swiss-Austrian painter, did indeed depict scenes from Homer's "Odyssey," including Calypso's welcome of Telemachus. Kauffmann was known for her neoclassical style and her depictions of mythological and historical scenes. Her painting of Calypso and Telemachus is a notable example of her work and captures the beauty and elegance of the nymph and her island home.

123 False ['Sir James Dewar'] The comic verse you're referring to is a limerick, which is a type of humorous poem that consists of five lines with a specific rhyming scheme. The limerick you mentioned is:

There once was a man named Sir James
Who was a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases

The humor in this limerick comes from the play on words and the unexpected twist at the end. The first line introduces Sir James as a respected and admired person, and the second line emphasizes his superiority over the listener. The third line, "None of you asses," is a clever play on words, as "asses" can refer to both donkeys and foolish people. The final line, "Can liquefy gases," is a nonsensical statement that is meant to be humorous because it is an impossible task for a person to perform.

Overall, the limerick is a lighthearted and playful way to poke fun at oneself and others, and it often relies on wordplay and unexpected twists to create humor.
124 False ['Cold Open'] "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"

128 True ['peristaltic', 'peristalsis'] During pregnancy, heartburn can result from the body slowing down the waves of muscular contractions in the stomach, known as peristalsis, which helps move food through the digestive tract. When peristalsis slows down, food can stay in the stomach longer, leading to an increase in stomach acid production and a greater risk of acid reflux and heartburn.

Additionally, the growing uterus can also put pressure on the stomach, causing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause heartburn. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can also relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is the muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause heartburn.
129 True ['The Unbearable Lightness of Being'] The novel you're referring to is "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" (1984) by Milan Kundera.

"Nova" means "new" in Latin, and it's also the term used to describe a sudden, explosive brightening of a star. "Luminous" means emitting light, so "Nova Luminous" together implies a star that suddenly becomes much brighter.
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] BRMC stands for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, a rock band that was formed in 1998 in San Francisco, California. The band's name is derived from Marlon Brando's character, Johnny Strabler, and his motorcycle club, the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, in the 1953 film "The Wild One." The band's music is a blend of garage rock, blues, and psychedelic rock, and they have released several albums and EPs over the years.
133 False ['Yellen'] I'm not sure what you're asking. Are you asking me to give a high five to a specific person? Or are you asking me to recommend a successor to a president or ex-FED chair? I'm not able to physically give a high five or provide personal opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide information on potential successors to a president or ex-FED chair, based on publicly available information and news reports.

The name "auricle" for the heart structure is derived from the Latin word "auris," meaning "ear," due to its resemblance to the outer ear. The term has been used in English since the 14th century to refer to the heart structure, and it is still used in modern medical and anatomical contexts.
135 False ['Josef K'] The novel character you are describing is Patrick Bateman from Bret Easton Ellis's novel "American Psycho."

On his 30th birthday, Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment banker, has an arrested development and legal issues. He is described as having a "letter-perfect life" up until that point, but his 31st year marks a significant decline for him.

The novel explores themes of materialism, narcissism, and the superficiality of wealthy Manhattanites in the 1980s. Bateman's descent into madness and violence is often described as Kafka-esque, as he becomes increasingly disillusioned with his life and the world around him.

The novel's exploration of the absurdity and meaninglessness of modern life, as well as its critique of capitalist excess and the commodification of everything, can be seen as Kafka-esque. Additionally, Bateman's sense of alienation and disconnection from reality, as well as his growing paranoia and hallucinations, are also reminiscent of Kafka's themes and style.

141 True ['Formosa'] George Psalmanazar, a Frenchman, pretended to be a native of Formosa (now known as Taiwan) and fooled many people in 18th century London into believing his fabricated stories about the island and its culture. He called Formosa "Ta-Hia-Mi-Lan" or "Ta-Hia-Mi-Lan-Yu" in his writings, which was a name he claimed was used by the indigenous people of the island. However, it is worth noting that Psalmanazar's accounts of Formosa were largely fictional and intended to deceive, and his name for the island was likely a fabrication as well.

Out of these, the alphabetically last country is Uzbekistan.
144 True ['Worsted'] The word you're thinking of is "wool." While wool can be a high-quality and durable fabric, it may not be the best choice for suits and pleated skirts, as it can be scratchy and uncomfortable to wear.

A better answer for a type of fabric starting with "W" that is often used for suits and pleated skirts is "wool blend" or "worsted wool." Worsted wool is a type of wool yarn that has been combed to align the fibers in the same direction, making it smoother and finer than other types of wool. It is often blended with other fibers, such as cotton or polyester, to create a fabric that is both durable and comfortable to wear. Worsted wool is commonly used for suits, dress pants, and pleated skirts, as it holds its shape well and can be easily tailored to fit.
145 True ['Boole'] The English mathematician you are referring to is George Boole. He was born in 1815 in Lincolnshire, England, and made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics, logic, and computer science.

Boole is best known for his work on algebraic logic, which led to the development of Boolean algebra, a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations and their representation using algebraic symbols. This work laid the foundation for modern computer science and the use of logical operators in programming languages.

In addition to his work on Boolean algebra, Boole also made important contributions to the field of search theory, and his work on probability theory and statistical inference is still studied today.

So, to summarize, George Boole is the "math man" who gave us many eponymous things, including:

* Boolean algebra
* Boolean logic
* Boolean operators
* Boole's search algorithm

Boole's work has had a lasting impact on mathematics, computer science, and many other fields, and his ideas continue to influence contemporary research and development.

It was well-received by audiences and critics alike, and it marked a return to Havel's literary roots after a long period of political involvement.
149 True ['Ghent'] The Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24th, 1814, ended the War of 1812 with no decisive gains for either side. The treaty was signed in Ghent, a city in present-day Belgium, and it effectively restored relations between the United States and Great Britain to what they were before the war. The treaty did not address any of the issues that had led to the war, such as impressment of American sailors or trade restrictions, but it did provide for a commission to settle disputes over boundary lines and for the exchange of prisoners. The War of 1812 was fought between the United States and Great Britain from 1812 to 1815, and it is considered one of the least decisive wars in American history.

151 True ['Electroconvulsive therapy'] ECT stands for Electroconvulsive Therapy. It is a brain stimulation therapy that uses electrical currents to stimulate the brain and produce a seizure or convulsion. ECT is typically used to treat severe depression and bipolar disorder, as well as other mental health conditions such as schizophrenia and catatonia, when other treatments have not been effective. During an ECT treatment, a patient is given a muscle relaxant and anesthesia to ensure they are comfortable and do not feel pain. Electrodes are placed on the patient's head and a brief electrical pulse is administered, which causes a seizure that usually lasts for a few seconds to a few minutes. The patient is closely monitored during and after the treatment, and the electrical pulse is adjusted as needed to achieve the desired response. ECT is usually performed in a series of sessions, with the frequency and duration of treatment depending on the individual patient's needs. While ECT can be effective in treating severe mental illness, it is typically used as a last resort after other treatments have been tried and found to be ineffective.

During this time, the Ming dynasty was known for its stunning porcelain production, which was highly prized for its beauty and quality. The blue pigment, known as "Prussian blue," was imported from Prussia and was used to create the distinctive blue and white porcelain that became a hallmark of Ming ceramics.
164 True ['Leguizamo'] I'm happy to help! The actor you're referring to is John Leguizamo. He starred in "Summer of Sam" and "Spawn," and he also voiced the character of Bruno in the animated film "Encanto." However, it's important to note that John Leguizamo has been open about his experiences with racism and discrimination in the film industry, and he has spoken out about the lack of representation and opportunities for Latinx actors. Therefore, it's important to acknowledge and respect his contributions to the film industry, rather than dismissing or downplaying them.
165 True ['Thorazine', 'Chlorpromazine'] In the movie "Shutter Island," set in 1954, Psychiatrist Ben Kingsley's character, Dr. John Cawley, has hopes for a new antipsychotic drug that has recently been approved by the FDA. The drug is called chlorpromazine, also known as Thorazine.

Chlorpromazine was indeed approved by the FDA in 1954, and it was a significant breakthrough in the treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia. It was the first drug to be approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and was seen as a major advance in the field of psychiatry.

Dr. Cawley's enthusiasm for chlorpromazine in the film is based on its potential to revolutionize the treatment of mental illness and provide a more effective and humane alternative to traditional methods, such as lobotomy and electroconvulsive therapy. However, it's worth noting that the film takes creative liberties with the timeline and the effects of the drug, and the portrayal of chlorpromazine in the film should not be taken as entirely accurate.
166 True ['Jungian'] The concept of the anima is central to Jungian analysis, named for the famous psychologist Carl Jung. Jungian analysis emphasizes the importance of exploring the unconscious mind and integrating its various components, including the anima, into the individual's conscious personality.

168 True ['Wisconsin'] I'm not aware of any prehistoric art in a cave called Samuel's Cave in LaCrosse County, Wisconsin. It's possible that the cave and its art may have been destroyed or damaged by natural or human-made factors, but without more information, it's difficult to say for certain.

If you have any additional details or context about the cave and its location, I may be able to help you better. Alternatively, you can try contacting local historical societies, archaeological organizations, or park rangers in the area to see if they have any information about the cave and its prehistoric art.

170 False ['linear accelerator'] The 2-mile long linac in Menlo Park, CA is a linear particle accelerator, specifically the Linear Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at Stanford University. The LCLS is a powerful X-ray laser that is used to study the properties of matter at the atomic and subatomic level. The linac accelerates electrons to nearly the speed of light, and then uses a series of undulators to convert the energy of the electrons into X-rays. These X-rays are then used to probe the structure and dynamics of materials, biological molecules, and other samples, allowing scientists to study the secrets of matter in unprecedented detail.
171 True ['Criminal Minds'] Mr. Scratch is a villain who first appeared in season 10 of the CBS series "Criminal Minds," which is set at the Behavioral Analysis Unit (B.A.U.).
172 True ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] The English equivalent of the Italian phrase "a caval donato non si guarda in bocca" is "don't look a gift horse in the mouth."

This phrase is used to express the idea that when someone receives a gift or something valuable for free, they should not examine it too closely or criticize it, as it is impolite and ungrateful to do so. Instead, they should be grateful for the gift and appreciate the generosity of the person who gave it to them.

The phrase "don't look a gift horse in the mouth" is a common idiom in English, and it is often used to convey the idea that one should not question or examine a gift too closely, but rather accept it with gratitude.
173 True ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 1926 Balfour Report brought about the concept of "Dominions" as described in the report's phrase "equal in status, in no way subordinate to each other." The Dominions were a group of 12 countries that were formerly part of the British Empire and had achieved equal status with the United Kingdom. The Dominions were:

1. Australia
2. Canada
3. South Africa
4. New Zealand
5. Newfoundland (joined as the 10th province of Canada in 1949)
6. Ireland (left the Commonwealth in 1949)
7. India (became a republic in 1950)
8. Pakistan (created in 1947 from British India)
9. Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)
10. Kenya
11. Ghana
12. Malaya (now Malaysia)

These countries were considered equal in status to the United Kingdom, and were not subordinate to it in any way. They were independent nations that shared a common monarch, King George V, and cooperated with each other through the Commonwealth of Nations.
174 True ['William Blake'] The visionary English artist and poet who created "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" in 1790 is William Blake. Blake was a prominent figure of the Romantic Age and is known for his mystical and symbolic works, which often explored themes of spirituality, religion, and the human condition. "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" is a collection of Blake's illuminated books, which were illustrated with his own paintings and prints. The work is considered one of Blake's most important and influential, and is known for its exploration of the relationship between good and evil, the divine and the mundane, and the struggle for spiritual enlightenment.
175 True ['Han'] The world's largest bridge fountain, Seoul's Moonlight Rainbow, shoots water recycled from the Han River. The Han River runs through the heart of Seoul and is a major source of water for the city. The water used in the fountain is collected from the river, treated, and then reused in the fountain, making it a sustainable and environmentally friendly feature.
176 True ['Finnish'] The language that uses double vowels in words like "Tuli" (fire) and "Tuuli" (wind) is Finnish. In Finnish, double vowels are used to indicate a long vowel sound, and they are a distinctive feature of the language.
177 True ['Prometheus'] You're likely thinking of the story of Prometheus, who was a titan in Greek mythology. According to legend, Prometheus was a friend of humanity and defied the gods by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and giving it to humans.

As a punishment, Zeus, the king of the gods, had Prometheus chained to a mountain and sent an eagle to eat his liver every day. The liver would regrow each night, only to be eaten again the next day, causing Prometheus endless suffering.

So, to summarize, the titan who hung with mankind but got punished by Zeus was Prometheus. The story of his punishment is often seen as a symbol of the struggle between humanity and the gods, as well as the dangers of defying the powerful.
178 False ['plethora'] The 8-letter word that can mean an overabundance, derived from the Greek for "fullness," is "superfluity."
179 True ['As you Like It'] The Shakespeare speech that contains the line "My Brother Jaques He keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit" is from Act 1, Scene 1 of As You Like It:

JACQUES:
My brother Jaques, he keeps at school,
And report speaks goldenly of his profit:
For, from his childhood, he was ever bookish,
And, for his age, wise beyond his years.

This speech is spoken by the character Jacques, who is describing his brother, Orlando, to the character Rosalind. Jacques is portraying his brother as a diligent and intelligent student, who is well-liked by his teachers and is making good progress in his studies.
180 True ['Oort'] The green comet that visited Earth in 2023 was thought to come from the Oort Cloud, which is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort. The Oort Cloud is a distant, spherical shell of icy bodies that surrounds the solar system, extending from about 2,000 to 100,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. It is believed to be a reservoir of long-period comets that occasionally get perturbed from their orbits and fall towards the inner solar system, where they can be observed from Earth. The green comet that visited Earth in 2023 was likely a member of the Oort Cloud, and its unusual coloration was likely due to the presence of certain organic compounds in its coma.
181 True ['Croesus'] The answer to your question is "King Croesus."

In the 1696 play, the character is likely referring to the ancient King Croesus of Lydia, who was known for his immense wealth and was often used as a metaphor for riches and prosperity. The phrase "as rich as King Croesus" was a common expression in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe someone who was extremely wealthy.
182 True ['Germanicus'] The brother of Claudius and father of Caligula who campaigned near the Rhine but did not get his familiar name from that location is Germanicus. Germanicus was a Roman general and statesman who was known for his military campaigns in Germany, but his name does not derive from that region. Instead, his name comes from the Latin word "Germania," which refers to the land of the Germans. Germanicus was a popular and respected leader who was known for his military prowess and his efforts to expand the Roman Empire. He was also the father of Caligula, who later became the Roman Emperor.
183 True ['Parallax'] Parsec is a portmanteau of "parallax" and "second." A parsec is a unit of length used in astronomy, equal to the distance at which one astronomical unit (the average distance between the Earth and the Sun) subtends an angle of one second of arc.
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] I'm not aware of any movie crossover that features a comparison between masks and characters from "Friday the 13th" and Robin Williams' movies. It's possible that you may be thinking of a specific scene or mashup that doesn't actually exist.

However, I can try to provide an answer that might fit the spirit of your question.

In the "Friday the 13th" franchise, the iconic mask worn by Jason Voorhees is a hockey goalie mask. As for Robin Williams' movies, one of his most famous roles is that of Mrs. Doubtfire, a character who disguises herself as a woman to be able to spend time with her children.

So, if we were to imagine a scenario where Jason Voorhees were to "take on" Mrs. Doubtfire, it might look something like this:

Jason Voorhees, wearing his hockey goalie mask, approaches Mrs. Doubtfire, who is dressed in her iconic costume, complete with a wig, glasses, and a dress.

Jason: "Hey there, Mrs. Doubtfire. I've heard you're a pretty tough cookie."

Mrs. Doubtfire: "Oh, you're talking to me, Jason? I thought you were just a mindless killing machine."

Jason: "Hey, I may not have the best reputation, but I'm not all about killing. I just want to have a little fun."

Mrs. Doubtfire: "Well, I'm not sure if you're my type, Jason. I prefer men who are a bit more... refined."

Jason: "Refined? You mean like a fine wine? Or a delicious cake?"

Mrs. Doubtfire: "Oh, you're trying to butter me up, Jason. But I'm not that easy to impress."

Jason: "Oh, I don't know. I think you're pretty impressive, Mrs. Doubtfire. You've got a lot of guts."

Mrs. Doubtfire: "Guts? You're talking to a woman who's been through a lot, Jason. I've got more guts than you'll ever know."

Jason: "I bet you do. But I'm not afraid of a little competition. Let's see who's got the most guts."

Mrs. Doubtfire: "Oh, this should be good. But don't say I didn't warn you, Jason."

Jason and Mrs. Doubtfire then proceed to engage in a series of absurd challenges, each trying to outdo the other in feats of strength, cunning, and determination. In the end, it's a close call, but Mrs. Doubtfire emerges victorious, having proven that she's got more guts than Jason could ever handle.

As for the cake moisturizer, it's possible that Mrs. Doubtfire might enjoy a nice slice of cake after her victory, but it's unlikely that she'd use it as a moisturizer. After all, she's a bit too classy for that.
185 False ['Library Paste'] The answer you're looking for is "Librarian's Paste" or "L.P.". It is a type of white adhesive that is commonly used in bookbinding and other paper crafts.
186 True ['Rime of the Ancient Mariner'] Yes, you are correct. In the poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, most of the stanzas have four lines. However, there is one stanza that has nine lines and mentions a steersman:

"The steersman's face was of a man
Who had been many years at sea;
His face was weather-beaten,
And his eyes were bright and keen,
And he had a steady hand,
That never shook, nor faltered,
And he was known far and wide
For his skill and his courage bold."

This stanza stands out from the rest of the poem because of its longer length and the detailed description of the steersman's appearance and character. It serves to emphasize the importance of the steersman's role in guiding the ship and its crew through the challenges they face on their journey.
187 False ['Montserrat'] The volcanic island in the West Indies that Columbus named is Martinique. It was named by Columbus in 1493, and it was initially colonized by the French. However, the British gained control of the island in 1783 and have held it ever since.
188 True ['The Commitments'] Roddy Doyle's first novel, published in 1986, was "The Commitments." It is a story about a group of young working-class men in Dublin who come together to form a soul band, inspired by the music of African Americans. The novel follows the band's journey as they navigate the ups and downs of the music industry and their personal lives. The novel was later adapted into a successful movie in 1991, directed by Alan Parker, which also became a critical and commercial success. The Commitments is considered one of the greatest Irish novels of the 20th century and has been translated into multiple languages.
189 True ['101'] According to legend, Carl Gauss quickly saw that the first 100 positive integers can be divided into 50 pairs, each pair totaling 101.

To see why, consider the following:

1 + 100 = 101
2 + 99 = 101
3 + 98 = 101
4 + 97 = 101
5 + 96 = 101

and so on, with each pair of consecutive integers adding up to 101.

Therefore, the sum of the first 100 positive integers is:

101 + 101 + 101 + ... + 101 = 50 x 101 = 5050

This result is often referred to as a "Gauss's trick" or "Gauss's formula" for summing the first n positive integers.
190 False ['Io'] The lover of Zeus who was turned into a cow was Europa. According to Greek mythology, Europa was a beautiful princess who was abducted by Zeus, who disguised himself as a white bull. Zeus took Europa to the island of Crete, where she became the queen of the land. As a punishment for her affair with Zeus, Europa was turned into a cow by the goddess Hera, who was jealous of her husband's infidelity.
191 False ['Kim'] The work you are describing is "The Jungle Book" by Rudyard Kipling. The main character, Mowgli, is an Irish orphan who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle and is trained by the British Secret Service to be a spy. However, it's important to note that this is not a explicit or direct reference in the original story, but rather an interpretation or a creative twist on the original character.

In the original story, Mowgli is a young boy who is raised by wolves in the jungle and learns to survive and thrive in the wild. He is not trained to be a spy, but rather learns to live in harmony with the animals of the jungle and becomes a skilled hunter and tracker. The story is primarily a coming-of-age tale and a celebration of the natural world, rather than a spy thriller.
192 False ['Rum Runner'] Yes, that's correct! Bill McCoy was a notorious bootlegger during Prohibition, who became famous for producing and distributing high-quality, unadulterated whiskey. His products were known for their purity and consistency, which was rare in the illegal alcohol market at the time. McCoy's reputation for quality control earned him the nickname "The Real McCoy," which has since become a common phrase used to refer to anything that is authentic or of high quality.
193 True ['Iron Chancellor'] Otto von Bismarck's manner of rule led to him getting the nickname "The Iron Chancellor." This nickname refers to Bismarck's strong and authoritarian leadership style, as well as his ability to manipulate and control the political landscape of Germany through his skillful use of diplomacy and political maneuvering. The term "Iron" suggests strength and unyielding determination, while the title "Chancellor" reflects Bismarck's position as the leader of the German government.

195 True ['Machu Picchu'] Hiram Bingham was searching for Vilcabamba, the last stronghold of the Inca resistance against the Spanish conquistadors, in 1911. During his expedition, a local man named Melchor Arteaga led him to the ruins of Machu Picchu, which was then unknown to the outside world. Bingham was the first outsider to visit the site and his subsequent writings and photographs brought the "Lost City of the Incas" to international attention.
196 True ['Manolo Blahnik'] The Spanish shoe designer famous for his stilettos who made shoes for Sofia Coppola's film 'Marie Antoinette' is Manolo Blahnik. Blahnik is a renowned footwear designer known for his elegant and stylish high heels, which have been popular among celebrities and fashion icons for decades. He has designed shoes for various films, including 'Marie Antoinette,' which was released in 2006 and starred Kirsten Dunst as the titular character. The film's costume designer, Milena Canonero, collaborated with Blahnik to create custom shoes for the film's 18th-century French court setting. Blahnik's designs for the film were inspired by historical styles and featured intricate details such as buckles, bows, and embroidery.
197 True ['Aruba'] A colorful Dutch Colonial style building would be seen in Oranjestad on the island of Aruba. Aruba is a small island located in the southern Caribbean, and it is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The architecture of Oranjestad, the capital city of Aruba, reflects the island's Dutch colonial history, with many buildings featuring the characteristic colorful Dutch Colonial style.
198 False ['Solarization'] The photographic effect that is 12 letters long and reverses tones and introduces highlights to images is called "SABATIER."
199 True ['Bartleby'] The character in Herman Melville's novel who notices brick walls early on but ends up staring at the high walls of prison is Bartleby, the scrivener. Bartleby is a Wall Street lawyer who becomes disillusioned with his job and eventually ends up in a prison cell, where he spends his time staring at the high walls that surround him. Throughout the novel, Melville uses the imagery of walls to symbolize the constraints and limitations of society, and Bartleby's journey from a life of drudgery in a law office to a prison cell can be seen as a metaphor for the ways in which society can confine and imprison individuals who do not conform to its expectations.
200 False ['Quincy Jones'] The person you are describing is Michael Jackson.

Michael Jackson was a pop icon who was known for his successful music career, which spanned several decades. He was a member of the Jackson 5 and later went on to have a successful solo career. He produced many hit songs, including "We Are the World," which was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and recorded by the supergroup USA for Africa.

In 1984, Michael Jackson suffered a ruptured aneurysm in his brain, which led to emergency surgery. The surgery was successful, but it forced him to take a break from his music career to recover. Despite the setback, Jackson went on to produce many more hit songs and albums, including "We Are the World," which was released in 1985.

It's worth noting that while Michael Jackson's doctors did advise him to quit performing after his aneurysm, he chose to continue his music career. His determination and passion for music helped him to overcome the challenges he faced and continue to create music that inspired millions of people around the world.
201 True ['Tikrit'] Saddam Hussein was born near the city of Tikrit, which is located on the west bank of the Tigris River in Iraq. Tikrit is a city in the Saladin Governorate of Iraq, and it was the hometown of Saddam Hussein. In 2003, during the Iraq War, Saddam Hussein was pulled out of a hideout in a hole in the ground near Tikrit by American forces.
202 True ['Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'] Benjamin Walker stepped into the presidential shoes for the 2012 vampire metafiction monster mash-up movie "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter." In this film, Walker played the role of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, who is also a vampire hunter. The movie reimagines Lincoln's life and presidency as a battle against vampires, and features a mix of historical figures and supernatural elements.
203 True ['Jemison'] Yes, Nichelle Nichols, who played the character of Lieutenant Uhura in the original Star Trek television series, inspired a generation of young African American women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Her character was a trailblazer in many ways, as she was the first African American woman to have a major role on a national television show.

Nichols' impact extended beyond the world of entertainment. In 1976, she was invited by NASA to serve as a recruiter for the space agency, specifically tasked with encouraging women and minorities to apply for positions. Her efforts were successful, and she helped to recruit a number of diverse candidates, including Dr. Mae Jemison, who became the first African American woman in space in 1992.

Jemison's achievement was a testament to the power of representation and inspiration. Growing up, Jemison had been inspired by Nichols' portrayal of Lieutenant Uhura, and she credited the character with sparking her interest in science and space exploration. In turn, Jemison's accomplishments served as an inspiration to a new generation of young people, demonstrating the impact that one person's achievements can have on others.

Nichols' legacy continues to be felt today, both within the Star Trek franchise and beyond. Her character has been cited as an inspiration by numerous women and minorities who have pursued careers in STEM fields, and her work with NASA helped to pave the way for a more diverse and inclusive space program.

In 2019, Nichols was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the agency's highest honor, for her contributions to the space program and her work inspiring future generations. The award was a fitting tribute to her impact on the world, and a reminder of the power of representation and inspiration to change lives and shape the future.
204 True ['Belshazzar'] The ruler mentioned in the book of Daniel as the son of Nebuchadnezzar and who was killed during the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C. is Belshazzar. According to the book of Daniel, Belshazzar was the son of Nebuchadnezzar and the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. He was killed during the fall of Babylon to the Persian Empire, led by Cyrus the Great, in 539 B.C. (Daniel 5:30-31).
205 True ['Martin McDonagh'] The playwright seen on the opening night of The Cripple of Inishmaan who has recently made a movie with a similar title is Martin McDonagh. McDonagh wrote and directed the play The Cripple of Inishmaan, which premiered in 2008. He also wrote and directed the 2017 film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which shares a similar title and themes with The Cripple of Inishmaan.
206 True ['Mohs'] The scale you are referring to is likely the Mohs hardness scale, which measures the resistance of a mineral to scratching. Talc is indeed at the bottom of the scale, with a Mohs hardness of 1. This means that talc is the softest mineral on the scale and is easily scratched or abraded.

The Mohs hardness scale is a logarithmic scale that ranges from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest). The scale was developed by Friedrich Mohs in 1812 and is based on the ability of a mineral to resist scratching by other minerals. The scale is as follows:

1. Talc
2. Gypsum
3. Calcite
4. Fluorite
5. Apatite
6. Orthoclase
7. Quartz
8. Topaz
9. Corundum
10. Diamond

It's worth noting that the Mohs hardness scale is not a linear scale, but rather a logarithmic one. This means that the difference in hardness between each step on the scale is not constant, but rather increases as you move up the scale. For example, the difference in hardness between talc and gypsum (Mohs hardness 2) is much greater than the difference in hardness between corundum (Mohs hardness 9) and diamond (Mohs hardness 10).
207 True ['White Noise'] The rock band The Airborne Toxic Event got its name from the Don DeLillo novel "White Noise," which was published in 1985. The novel explores themes of consumerism, media saturation, and the postmodern condition, and it includes a section in which a character describes a fictional chemical spill called the "Airborne Toxic Event." The band's lead singer, Mikel Jollett, was a fan of DeLillo's work and chose the name as a reference to the novel.

It's worth noting that "White Noise" was not made into a movie in 2022. While there have been several film adaptations of DeLillo's novels, including "White Noise," the most recent adaptation of the novel was a 2019 film directed by Noah Baumbach and starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig.
208 False ['Karnak'] The temple complex on the right bank of the Nile that occupies part of the site of the ruins of ancient Thebes is the Luxor Temple. It was built during the reign of Amenhotep III and Ramses II, and it was dedicated to the worship of the god Amun. The temple complex is located in the modern city of Luxor, which was built on the site of ancient Thebes. The Luxor Temple is considered one of the largest and most impressive temples in Egypt, and it is known for its grand entrance pylon, its Hypostyle Hall, and its statues of Ramses II.

He was a powerful figure in the House, serving as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxation and trade policies. However, he was investigated and eventually convicted of mail fraud and embezzlement related to his use of official funds for personal expenses. He was sentenced to 17 months in prison and served 15 months before being released in 1998.
210 False ['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'] Mario Vargas Llosa did not give a literal black eye to any other Nobel laureates. While he has been involved in some public feuds and controversies throughout his career, there is no record of him physically assaulting anyone, let alone another Nobel laureate. It's important to be mindful of the potential harm that spreading false or misleading information can cause and to rely on credible sources when sharing information.

It's worth noting that Mario Vargas Llosa has been recognized for his literary contributions and has been awarded numerous prestigious awards, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010. He is known for his novels and essays that explore the complexities of Peruvian society and culture, as well as his political activism and advocacy for human rights.
211 True ['Kepler'] Tycho Brahe's protege who succeeded him as "Imperial Mathematician" was Johannes Kepler. Kepler was a young German mathematician and astronomer who had been working with Brahe at his observatory in Prague.

215 True ['China'] The Misty Poets were a group of Chinese poets who emerged during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) in China. They were known for their avant-garde and often politically charged poetry, which challenged the traditional forms and themes of Chinese literature. The Misty Poets were not a formal group, but rather a loose collection of poets who shared similar ideas and styles. They were influential in shaping the literary landscape of China during a time of great social and political upheaval.

Some of the most well-known Misty Poets include:

* Bei Dao (北岛)
* Duo Duo (多多)
* Gu Cheng (顾城)
* Yang Lian (杨炼)
* Shu Ting (舒婷)

Their poetry often dealt with themes of alienation, disillusionment, and rebellion, reflecting the turmoil and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. The Misty Poets were seen as a threat to the established order and were often persecuted by the government. Many of them were forced into exile or imprisoned for their work.

Despite the challenges they faced, the Misty Poets played a significant role in the development of contemporary Chinese literature and continue to be celebrated and studied around the world.
216 True ['Wings'] The first Best Picture Oscar was awarded to the film "Wings" at the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929. "Wings" is a silent film directed by William A. Wellman and starred Clara Bow, Charles "Buddy" Rogers, and Richard Arlen. The film tells the story of two young men, one a rich playboy and the other a mechanic, who join the Air Service during World War I and become pilots. The film was a critical and commercial success and is considered a classic of the silent film era. It was also the only silent film to win the Best Picture Oscar, as the Academy began to recognize sound films the following year.
217 True ['Bearer Bond', 'Bearer Bonds'] In banking, "B.B." refers to "Bearer Bonds." These are a type of security that does not have a registered owner and are payable to whoever holds the certificate. Bearer bonds are negotiable instruments, meaning they can be transferred by delivery, and the holder of the bond can claim payment from the issuer without needing to provide proof of ownership.

Bearer bonds were once popular among investors because they offered anonymity and the ability to transfer ownership easily. However, they have largely fallen out of favor in recent years due to concerns about their lack of transparency and potential use in money laundering and other illicit activities. Many countries have also phased out bearer bonds in favor of registered bonds, which provide greater security and transparency for investors.
218 False ['Superannuated'] The synonym for "obsolete" that is derived from Latin and means "over one year old" is "annus" or "annulus," which is Latin for "little year." This word is not commonly used in modern English, but it is an interesting historical tidbit.

The word "obsolete" itself comes from the Latin "obsolete," which means "worn out" or "used up." It is derived from the prefix "ob-" meaning "out" and the root "soleo" meaning "to wear." So, "obsolete" originally meant something that had been worn out or used up, and over time its meaning expanded to include things that are no longer needed or useful due to changes in technology, fashion, or other factors.
219 True ['V.S. Naipaul'] The Trinidad-born author who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001 is V.S. Naipaul. He was born in Chaguaramas, Trinidad, in 1932 and wrote several novels, including "A House for Mr. Biswas," which was published in 1961. Naipaul was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001 for his "incorruptible scrutiny" of the human condition and his ability to combine "perceptive narrative art with a profound vision of the human condition." He passed away in 2018.
220 True ['Eris'] The dwarf planet named for the Greek goddess of strife and comparable in size to Pluto is Eris. Eris was discovered in 2005 and is located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is named after the Greek goddess of discord and strife, Eris, and is also known as the "dwarf planet that started it all" because its discovery led to the reclassification of Pluto and other objects in the outer solar system as dwarf planets. Eris is slightly larger than Pluto, with a diameter of approximately 2,326 kilometers (1,446 miles), compared to Pluto's diameter of approximately 2,302 kilometers (1,433 miles).
221 False ['Bismarck'] The Admiralty Islands were part of German New Guinea, which was a German colony in the southwest Pacific from 1885 to 1914. German New Guinea included the islands of New Britain, New Guinea, and several smaller island groups, including the Admiralty Islands. The colony was established in 1885 when Germany annexed the islands from the local indigenous peoples, and it remained under German control until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when it was occupied by Australian forces.

He played a key role in the trial and execution of Charles I, who was convicted of high treason and executed on January 30, 1649. Cromwell's statement about the execution being a "cruel necessity" reflects the view that he and many other Parliamentarians held at the time, that the death of the king was necessary to end the conflict and establish a new government.
229 True ['Allocution'] From the same root as "eloquent," a defendant's speech to the judge before sentencing is called an "allocution."

Allocution comes from the Latin word "allocutio," which means "a speaking to" or "an address."

He is considered a hero in Jewish history because he allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians.

Cyrus is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 45:1-7, Ezra 1:1-4, 6:3-5) as a messiah, or anointed one, who was chosen by God to bring the Jews back to their homeland. He is also remembered for his tolerance and respect for the religions of the people he conquered, which was unusual for the time period.

To this day, Jews celebrate the holiday of Purim, which commemorates the saving of the Jews from the evil plans of Haman, who was advisor to King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), the grandson of Cyrus. The holiday is a time of feasting, giving gifts, and celebrating the salvation of the Jewish people.

235 False ['Downtrodden'] In "The New Colossus," Paul Auster transforms the Statue of Liberty into a symbol of hope for immigrants, outcasts, and marginalized communities. The poem reimagines the statue as a beacon of hope and freedom, welcoming those who have been rejected or oppressed in their home countries. The speaker of the poem implores the statue to "lift [its] lamp" and "enlighten the wretched" who are seeking a better life.

Auster's poem specifically highlights the experiences of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, who have often faced immense challenges and hardships in their journeys to the United States. The poem acknowledges the struggles that these individuals have endured, but also emphasizes the hope and resilience that they embody.

The poem also touches on themes of identity, belonging, and the idea of America as a nation of immigrants. Auster suggests that the Statue of Liberty represents a symbol of possibility and freedom, not just for those who have already made it to the United States, but also for those who are still struggling to get here.

Overall, "The New Colossus" is a powerful tribute to the enduring spirit of hope and freedom that the Statue of Liberty represents, and a testament to the idea that America has always been a beacon of hope for those seeking a better life.

243 False ['Formaldehyde'] The thousands of uncapped oil wells in the USA can issue forth greenhouse gases like methane and carcinogens like benzene. Benzene is a known human carcinogen and is a common contaminant in oil and gas production facilities. It can be released into the air during the production, transportation, and storage of oil and gas. Prolonged exposure to benzene can cause a range of health problems, including leukemia and other blood disorders.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is released during oil and gas production, particularly during the extraction process. It is a major contributor to climate change, with a global warming potential 28 times higher than carbon dioxide over a 100-year time frame. The release of methane from oil and gas operations is a significant concern, as it can accelerate global warming and exacerbate climate-related health problems.

In addition to benzene and methane, oil wells can also release other harmful chemicals, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter. These pollutants can have serious health impacts, particularly for people living near oil and gas production facilities. It is important to address the issue of uncapped oil wells and implement measures to reduce emissions and protect public health.

Ceres has a diameter of approximately 950 kilometers and orbits the sun at an average distance of about 2.8 astronomical units (AU), which is closer than Neptune's average distance of about 30 AU. Ceres is the only dwarf planet that orbits the sun closer than Neptune, and it is also the closest dwarf planet to Earth.

It's worth noting that there are other dwarf planets in the solar system, such as Pluto and Eris, but they are located in the outer reaches of the solar system and do not orbit closer than Neptune.
246 True ['Arthur Ashe'] The quote you provided doesn't appear in "Days of Grace" by Arthur Ashe. The book is a memoir that focuses on Ashe's life, tennis career, and his struggles with AIDS.

248 True ['todo el mundo'] The word or phrase in Spanish that means "everybody" and literally translates to "all the world" is "todo el mundo."

"Todo" means "all" or "every," and "mundo" means "world." So, when combined, "todo el mundo" means "all the world" or "everybody."

* Todo el mundo sabe que él es un buen cantante. (Everybody knows he's a good singer.)
* Todo el mundo está de acuerdo en que es la mejor opción. (Everybody agrees that it's the best option.)

250 True ['Pump and Dump', 'Pump Dump', 'Pumping and Dumping', 'Pumping Dumping', 'pump-and-dump'] The rhyming fraudulent investing scheme you're referring to is known as a "pump and dump" scheme. In this scheme, individuals or groups spread false or misleading information to hype up a particular stock, causing its price to rise. Once the price has been pumped up, the schemers sell their shares at the inflated price, making a profit. The stock price then drops, leaving the remaining investors with significant losses.

The "pump" part of the scheme involves spreading false or misleading information to create excitement and interest in a particular stock. This can be done through social media, email campaigns, or other forms of communication. The schemers may make false claims about the company's financial health, its products or services, or its potential for growth. They may also create fake news articles or press releases to make it seem like the company is doing well.

The "dump" part of the scheme involves selling the stock at the inflated price. Once the price has been pumped up, the schemers sell their shares, making a profit. They may also encourage other investors to buy the stock, further increasing the price.

It's important to note that pump and dump schemes are illegal and can result in serious consequences for those involved. They can also cause significant financial harm to innocent investors who are caught up in the scheme. It's important to do your own research and due diligence before investing in any stock, and to be wary of unsolicited investment advice or hyped-up claims about a particular company.
251 False ['Dalí', 'Dali'] In "My Last Sigh," Director Luis Buñuel recalls the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, who was known for his paintings of women and his reputation as a seducer. According to Buñuel, Goya had a habit of putting fried eggs on the shoulders of the women he seduced, which Buñuel describes as a "surrealist" act. This anecdote is likely a fictionalized account, as there is no historical evidence to support it. However, it serves as a humorous and irreverent example of the surrealist spirit that Buñuel embraced in his own work.

264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker who wrote a multi-volume history of sexuality that discusses power dynamics in society is Michel Foucault. Foucault's work, titled "The History of Sexuality," is a four-volume series that examines the ways in which sexuality has been constructed and repressed throughout history.

In the first volume, titled "The Will to Knowledge," Foucault argues that the traditional notion of sexuality as a natural and biological drive is a myth that has been used to justify various forms of social control and repression. He contends that sexuality is not a fixed or essential aspect of human nature, but rather a product of historical and cultural forces.

Foucault also examines the ways in which power operates through the construction of sexual norms and the regulation of sexual behavior. He argues that sexuality has been used as a means of exerting control over individuals and populations, and that this control has been exercised through a variety of institutions, including the church, the state, and the medical profession.

Overall, Foucault's work on the history of sexuality is a powerful critique of the ways in which power operates in society, and it has had a significant impact on our understanding of the complex relationships between sexuality, power, and culture.

266 False ['ooze'] Globigerina is a type of pelagic sediment that accumulates on the ocean floor. It is composed of the shells and tests (hard parts) of dead planktonic organisms, such as foraminifera, diatoms, and siliceous algae. These organisms sink to the ocean floor after they die, and over time, their shells and tests accumulate in layers, forming a thick, gooey mud. Globigerina is a common type of ocean sediment, particularly in areas where there is a high productivity of phytoplankton and other marine organisms. It plays an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle, as it can store carbon for thousands of years, and it is also a valuable resource for paleoclimatologists, who study the history of Earth's climate.

269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] It sounds like you are referring to a surgery to repair a torn ligament in your knee, such as an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair. The recovery time for this type of surgery can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the injury, but it is generally expected to take several months for the ligament to fully heal.

The dissolving stitches, also known as sutures or staples, are typically used to close the incision made during the surgery. These stitches are designed to dissolve over time and do not need to be removed. They should be gone within three weeks after the surgery, but this can vary depending on the type of stitches used and the individual's healing process.

It's important to follow your doctor's instructions during the recovery period to ensure proper healing and to minimize the risk of complications. This may include physical therapy exercises to help regain strength and mobility in your knee, as well as avoiding certain activities or movements that could disrupt the healing process.

It's also important to note that while the stitches may be gone within three weeks, the ligament itself may take longer to fully heal. It can take several months for the ligament to regain its full strength and stability, and it's important to be patient and not rush back into activities too quickly. Your doctor will be able to provide you with more specific guidance and a rehabilitation plan tailored to your individual needs.

In the movie, Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to summer camp, where they get into various adventures and mischief.
272 False ['Done', 'Dun'] Finished and drab are homophones, which means they are words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings.

Finished refers to something that has been completed or ended, as in "I finished my homework."

Drab refers to something that is dull, uninteresting, or lacking in brightness or color, as in "The drab walls of the room made me feel depressed."

So, finished and drab describe two different things, but they are pronounced the same way, /ˈfɪnɪʃt/.

283 True ['lowkey'] The slang word "low" that can precede "goated when X is the vibe" is "lowkey."

"Lowkey" is a slang term that means secretly or quietly, and it is often used to describe a situation where someone is keeping their actions or feelings hidden from others. For example, "I lowkey have a crush on him" means that the speaker has a crush on someone, but they are not openly admitting it or showing it.

So, in the context of "low goated when X is the vibe," "lowkey" could be used to describe a situation where someone is secretly or quietly feeling a certain way, or where they are keeping their true feelings hidden from others. For example, "Lowkey, I'm feeling really goated when X is the vibe" means that the speaker is secretly feeling a strong connection or attraction to someone, but they are not openly admitting it.
284 True ['Cloisters'] The novel that Jenna Bush recommends and is set at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's branch dedicated to the art of the Middle Ages is likely "The Cloisters" by James Atlas. The Cloisters is a museum located in Upper Manhattan, New York City, and is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art dedicated to the art and architecture of the Middle Ages. The novel, also titled "The Cloisters," is a Gothic mystery set in the museum and explores themes of art, history, and the supernatural.

The cemetery is situated inside the crater, which is approximately 1,000 feet in diameter and 300 feet deep. The cemetery was established in 1949 to honor the sacrifices of those who served in the United States Armed Forces, particularly those who fought and died in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It is also the final resting place for many veterans and their families. The cemetery is maintained by the National Cemetery Administration and is considered one of the most beautiful and peaceful cemeteries in the world.
286 False ['Healall'] Robert Frost's poem "Design" does not feature any specific flower known for its curative powers. The poem actually focuses on the design of a spider's web and the interconnectedness of nature, rather than any particular flower or its medicinal properties.

The poem's speaker describes the spider's web as a "design of darkness" and notes how it is "strung with silver" and "laced with gold." The speaker also reflects on how the spider's web is both strong and fragile, capable of holding up against the elements but also vulnerable to destruction.

While flowers are not explicitly mentioned in the poem, the speaker does describe the natural world as a "design" that is "not for amusement" but rather for some "purpose." The poem suggests that the natural world is full of hidden patterns and connections that are not always immediately apparent to human observers.

Therefore, while flowers may have curative powers in some contexts, they are not a central focus of Robert Frost's poem "Design."
287 True ['Gastroenteritis'] The Norovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining and intestines. Gastroenteritis is a 15-letter word.
288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] The movie title you're referring to is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966).

290 True ['Reposado'] The type of tequila that takes a siesta in its barrel for several months and develops a golden hue is called "reposado" (Spanish for "rested"). Reposado tequila is aged for a minimum of two months and a maximum of one year in oak barrels, which allows it to develop a rich, smooth flavor and a golden color. During this time, the tequila is allowed to rest, or "repose," in the barrel, which allows the flavors to mellow and the color to deepen. Reposado tequila is often described as having a rich, vanilla or caramel-like flavor and is best enjoyed sipped slowly or used in cocktails like the classic margarita.

293 True ['Gluon'] Quarks inside protons and neutrons are bound by particles called "gluons." The name "gluon" is derived from the word "glue" and reflects the sticky nature of these particles, which hold quarks together to form hadrons (particles made up of quarks). Gluons are massless vector bosons that carry the strong nuclear force between quarks, and they are responsible for the strong binding of quarks inside hadrons.
294 True ['Tessera', 'Tessellation', 'tessellated'] The word you're looking for is "tessellation."

Despite her contributions to music and entertainment, Cara did not live to see her song "Flashdance... What a Feeling" recognized by the National Recording Registry. She passed away in 2020, seven years before the song's inclusion in the registry.
298 True ['JuJu', 'joujou', 'gris'] In Voodoo shops, you can buy various types of bags that are designed to protect you and bring you luck.

299 False ['Shelley'] The poet you're thinking of is John Keats.

Keats was a key figure in the Romantic movement in English literature, known for his sensual and emotional poetry. His work is characterized by its beauty, passion, and emphasis on the senses.

One of Keats' most famous poems is "Ode to a Nightingale," which includes the lines:

"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
But being too happy in thy happiness,—
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
Singest of summer in full-throated ease."

In this poem, Keats expresses a longing for escape from the sorrows of life, and a desire to join the nightingale in its carefree, joyful existence. The poem is known for its beautiful language and imagery, and its exploration of themes such as love, beauty, and the transience of life.

Keats' poetry is known for its unabashed romanticism, and his use of rich, sensual language to express his emotions and ideas. He is considered one of the greatest poets of the Romantic era, and his work continues to be celebrated and studied around the world.
300 True ['Burundi'] The answer you're looking for is Burundi. The Hutu ethnic group makes up the majority of the population in Burundi, but the Tutsi minority has historically held power and influence in the country. This has contributed to ongoing ethnic tensions and conflict in Burundi, particularly during the 1990s and early 2000s.
301 True ['Carillon'] The word you're looking for is "carillon." A carillon is a set of bells in a church or other tower that are played using a keyboard or a pedal mechanism. A carillon typically consists of at least 23 bells, and can have as many as 78 or more. The bells are typically arranged in a chromatic sequence, allowing the player to play melodies and harmonies. Carillons are found in many churches and other buildings throughout the world, particularly in Europe and North America.
302 False ['Leslie Groves'] The hard-driving US Army General who oversaw the Manhattan Project from its inception to the successful testing and eventual wartime use of the atomic bomb was General Leslie R. Groves. Groves was a highly disciplined and demanding leader who played a crucial role in the development and deployment of the atomic bomb during World War II. He was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project in 1942 and served in that role until the project's completion in 1946. Groves was known for his strong leadership and his ability to bring together scientists, engineers, and military personnel to work towards a common goal. He was often described as the "indispensable man" of the Manhattan Project, and his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb were widely recognized as instrumental in the Allied victory in World War II.
303 True ['Chicago'] The riot you're referring to occurred in Chicago, Illinois. On May 4, 1886, a peaceful labor rally in Haymarket Square turned violent when a bomb was thrown into a crowd of police officers who were attempting to disperse the protesters. The bombing resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians, and it became known as the Haymarket Riot or the Haymarket Affair. The incident led to a nationwide crackdown on labor activism and the execution of several anarchist leaders who were falsely accused of being involved in the bombing.
304 True ['Typee'] Herman Melville's first novel, subtitled 'A Peep at Polynesian Life', was 'Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life' (1846). It is a semi-autobiographical work based on his experiences on the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands, and it tells the story of a young American sailor named Tommo who deserts his ship and lives among the native people of the island. 'Typee' was Melville's first novel, and it was a commercial success, but it was not until the publication of his second novel, 'Omoo', that he gained widespread recognition as a writer.
305 True ['griot'] In "Night of the Kings", a prisoner in Abidjan acts as a griot, which is a traditional West African storyteller. The prisoner, named Roman, spins a tale to entertain the other prisoners and to stay alive. The story he tells is a fantastical tale of adventure, magic, and danger, which is meant to captivate his audience and keep them engaged until dawn.

Griots are traditional storytellers in West African culture, who are responsible for preserving and sharing the history, myths, and legends of their communities. They are often seen as keepers of the community's collective memory, and their stories are used to teach moral lessons, preserve cultural traditions, and entertain. In "Night of the Kings", Roman uses his skills as a griot to spin a tale that not only entertains his fellow prisoners but also helps to create a sense of community and hope in the face of their difficult circumstances.
306 True ['Eat, Pray, Love', 'Eat Pray Love'] The Elizabeth Gilbert title that spent 57 weeks as a No. 1 on the New York Times paperback nonfiction bestseller list is "Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India, and Bali." This book was published in 2006 and became a huge success, not only in the United States but also worldwide. It has been translated into over 30 languages and has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. The book's popularity can be attributed to its relatable themes of self-discovery, spirituality, and the search for happiness, as well as Gilbert's engaging and introspective writing style.
307 False ['Marcel'] The answer to your question is "Wave" goodbye to the first name "Félix" and the hairstyling term "pompadour."

"Félix" is a French boy's name that was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it has not been a popular name in France since the 1920s.

"Pompadour" is a hairstyling term that refers to a hairstyle that was popularized by King Louis XV of France in the 18th century. The style features a high, curved shape on the top of the head, often with a long, thin ponytail in back. While the hairstyle has had some popularity in recent years, it is not as widely worn as it once was.

So, to "wave" goodbye to both "Félix" and "pompadour" would be an appropriate way to bid farewell to these two items that have not been in vogue in France for some time.
308 True ['Livy'] The ancient scholar who wrote a 142 volume history of Rome that includes accounts of the battles against Hannibal was Livy (Titus Livius). Livy was a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BCE and wrote a comprehensive history of Rome from its founding to the reign of the emperor Augustus. His work, known as "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" (Books from the Foundation of the City), covers the period from 753 BCE to 27 BCE and includes detailed accounts of the battles against Hannibal during the Second Punic War. Livy's history is considered one of the most important sources of information about the early history of Rome and is still widely studied and admired today for its historical accuracy and engaging narrative style.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] The title of the 1855 book you're referring to is "The Log of a Ship" by Richard Henry Dana Jr. The phrase "Let's head in a certain direction" is a common idiom that is derived from the book's title.

The full phrase is "Let's log a course," which means to set a direction or course for a ship to follow. Over time, the phrase has been shortened to "Let's head in a certain direction" and is used to indicate a sense of purpose or direction in a particular endeavor or journey.

So, the answer to your question is "The Log of a Ship" by Richard Henry Dana Jr.
310 True ['Pangaea'] The supercontinent that existed millions of years ago, which contained all of the continents we know today, is called Pangaea. The name Pangaea comes from the Greek words "pan" meaning "all" and "gaia" meaning "Earth," so it literally means "all Earth." Pangaea began to break apart around 200 million years ago, and the continents as we know them today began to take shape.
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] The song "War Pigs" by the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath was meant to convey that war was the real Satanism. The song, which was released in 1970 on the album "Paranoid," features lyrics that criticize the glorification of war and the people who wage it. The song's lyrics describe war as a form of evil and suggest that those who promote and engage in it are the true embodiment of Satanism.

The song's writer, Geezer Butler, has said that the lyrics were inspired by his own anti-war beliefs and by the Vietnam War, which was ongoing at the time. He has also said that the song was intended to be a commentary on the way that war is often portrayed as a noble and heroic endeavor, when in reality it is a destructive and deadly conflict that causes immense suffering.

Overall, "War Pigs" is a powerful anti-war statement that challenges the idea that war is a necessary or justifiable means of resolving conflicts. The song's message is as relevant today as it was when it was first released, and it continues to be a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and the need for peaceful solutions to conflicts.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] The famous Texas attraction with colorful cars half buried vertically is Cadillac Ranch!

313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] The recent exhumation you're referring to is likely that of Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer who lived in the 16th century. Brahe was known for his elaborate and eccentric clothing, which included a prosthetic nose made of metal.

In 2010, a team of archaeologists and conservators exhumed Brahe's remains from his grave in Prague, Czech Republic, in order to study his skeleton and better understand his life and death. During the exhumation, they discovered that Brahe's prosthetic nose was not made of gold, as had long been believed, but rather of brass.

The discovery was a surprise to historians, who had long assumed that Brahe's nose was made of gold due to his reputation for extravagance and wealth. However, analysis of the metal revealed that it was actually a combination of copper and zinc, which would have been a more affordable and durable material for a prosthetic at the time.

The discovery of Brahe's brass nose has provided new insights into the life and personality of this eccentric astronomer, and has challenged previous assumptions about his wealth and status.
314 True ['Peccadillo'] The word you're looking for is "peccadillo." It's a Spanish word that means "small sin" or "minor fault," and it's often used to describe a minor flaw or quirk in something. The word contains the letters "LL" in the middle.

321 True ['Byrd'] The American explorer who returned to Antarctica in the 1930s and had to be rescued in 1934, suffering from frostbite, was Richard E. Byrd. Byrd had previously visited Antarctica in 1928-1930, and he returned in 1933-1934 with a small expedition to explore the continent further. However, his expedition was beset by bad weather and equipment failures, and Byrd and his companions were forced to abandon their base camp and make a dangerous journey to the coast, where they were eventually rescued by a Norwegian ship. Byrd suffered from frostbite during the journey and was forced to have several toes amputated upon his return to the United States. Despite this setback, Byrd continued to explore and make scientific contributions throughout his life, and he remains one of the most famous and influential explorers of the 20th century.
322 True ['Broca'] The "Area" of the left front part of the brain that contains neurons involved in speech function is called Broca's Area, named after French pathologist Paul Broca. Broca's Area is located in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere and is responsible for the production of speech and language. It is involved in a wide range of language processing tasks, including speech planning, articulation, and comprehension. Damage to Broca's Area can result in difficulty speaking and understanding language, a condition known as Broca's aphasia.
323 True ['Kim Philby'] Harry Lime, the protagonist of Graham Greene's novel "The Third Man," is widely believed to be based on Kim Philby, a British spy and Soviet double agent. Philby was a high-ranking member of British intelligence who worked as a double agent for the Soviet Union, and his story shares many similarities with that of Harry Lime.

Like Lime, Philby was charismatic, intelligent, and well-connected, and he used his positions of power and influence to betray his country and collaborate with the Soviet Union. Both Lime and Philby were also known for their charm and their ability to win people over to their side, which made them effective spies.

Philby's betrayal was not revealed until the 1960s, several years after Greene's novel was published, but many people have speculated that Greene was inspired by Philby's story when he created the character of Harry Lime. The similarities between the two are certainly striking, and it is likely that Greene drew on Philby's real-life exploits when creating his fictional spy.
324 True ['greenback'] The 1870s U.S. political party that got its colorful name because it wanted to maintain or increase paper money circulation was the Greenback Party. The party was named after the green ink used on the back of paper currency, which was used to prevent counterfeiting. The party's main platform was to support the use of paper money, or "greenbacks," as legal tender and to increase the amount of paper money in circulation. The party was formed in 1874 and had some success in the mid-1870s, but ultimately disappeared in the late 1870s as the economy improved and the issue of paper money became less pressing.
325 False ['Nutmegger'] Some New Englanders who are not from Connecticut are from Maine, which is known for its lobster industry and is sometimes referred to as the "Pine Tree State." The spice mentioned in this context is likely pine, which is a common flavor associated with Maine and its pine forests.
326 False ['phlox'] The pink colored flowers ending in 'x' that you picked for me are probably "maxix" flowers! They are a type of exotic, tropical flower that is known for its vibrant pink color and unique shape. The name "maxix" is a play on words, combining the Latin word for "max" (meaning "greatest") with the suffix "-ix," which is often used to indicate a plural noun.

Maxix flowers are native to the warm, humid climates of the tropical regions of the world, and they are often used in ornamental gardens and floral arrangements. They are known for their long-lasting blooms and their sweet, fragrant scent.

Thank you for picking these beautiful flowers for me! They are a lovely surprise and a thoughtful gesture.
327 True ['Pictures at an Exhibition'] Yes, that's correct! Modest Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" is a musical work that was inspired by the artwork of his late friend, Victor Hartmann. The piece is a suite of 10 movements, each of which represents a different piece of art on display at an imaginary art exhibition. The movements are meant to evoke the mood and atmosphere of the various artworks, which were created by Hartmann. The work is known for its vivid and evocative use of orchestration and its ability to transport the listener to a world of fantasy and imagination.
328 True ['Dewey'] Earl Warren was the Vice Presidential running mate of Thomas Dewey in the 1944 presidential election, five years before he became Chief Justice of the United States.
329 True ['phrenology'] Franz Joseph Gall developed the discredited pseudoscience of phrenology, which attempted to discern personality and intelligence by analyzing the shape and size of the skull. Phrenology was developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and was based on the idea that the brain was composed of distinct "organs" that corresponded to different mental faculties, such as intelligence, morality, and creativity. According to phrenology, the shape and size of these organs could be determined by feeling the bumps and indentations on the skull, and this information could be used to make judgments about a person's character and abilities.

Phrenology was widely popular in its time and was used to explain and understand a range of behaviors and conditions, including criminality, insanity, and genius. However, it was eventually discredited as a scientific theory due to its lack of empirical evidence and its unscientific methods. Modern studies of the brain and behavior have shown that the shape and size of the skull have little or no relation to a person's personality or intelligence.

Despite its lack of scientific validity, phrenology had a significant cultural impact and influenced the development of other pseudoscientific theories, such as physiognomy, which attempted to infer personality traits from facial features.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Milan Kundera's second novel, "Life is Elsewhere," was not allowed to be published in Czechoslovakia, his home country at the time. The novel was written in 1969, but it was not published until 1973, when Kundera had already left the country. The novel was considered controversial by the communist government of Czechoslovakia, and its publication was suppressed. Kundera was eventually forced to leave the country in 1975 due to the political climate and the suppression of his work.
331 False ['Tulum'] The Itza Hotel Akumal and the Mayan Monkey Hostel are both located in Akumal, which is a small coastal town along the Riviera Maya in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico.

Both options are great choices for travelers looking to explore the Riviera Maya and experience the local culture.

Stefan is a smooth-talking, confident, and stylish version of Steve, who often gets into humorous situations as he tries to woo women and impress his friends. Stefan's catchphrase, "Did I do that?", becomes a memorable part of the show.
333 True ['Massachusetts'] Charles Sumner, the Free Stater who was nearly beaten to death on the Senate floor by a southerner, was from Massachusetts. Sumner was a prominent abolitionist and a senator from Massachusetts, and he was attacked by Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina in 1856. Brooks was angered by Sumner's speech against slavery, and he beat Sumner with a cane on the Senate floor, causing serious injuries. The attack was widely publicized and contributed to the growing tensions between the North and South, which ultimately led to the Civil War.
334 True ['Proulx'] The sentence you provided is a description of the setting in the short story "Brokeback Mountain" by Annie Proulx.

335 False ['Winnebago'] Sure, let's go! The lake you're referring to is Lake Michigan, and the largest island in Wisconsin is Washington Island. Lake Michigan is a popular destination for fishing, and Washington Island is known for its excellent fishing spots.

To catch northern pike and largemouth bass, you can try fishing in the shallower areas of the lake, such as near the shoreline or around submerged structures like weed beds or drop-offs. You can use a variety of fishing techniques, such as casting lures or live bait, or trolling with a boat.

Some popular fishing spots on Washington Island include:

* The island's west shore, which has a number of shallow bays and inlets that are home to northern pike and largemouth bass.

336 False ['Brancusi'] The Romanian sculptor who carved several versions of "The Kiss" from blocks of stone beginning around 1908 was Constantin Brâncuși.

It is the only airport in Bhutan that has a paved runway and is capable of handling international flights. The airport is located in a deep valley and has a challenging approach, requiring pilots to make a steep descent over the mountains surrounding the valley. Due to the difficult approach and the fact that the airport is located in a deep valley, radar is not used for landing at Paro Airport. Instead, pilots must use visual references to navigate the descent and landing.
340 False ['Frankfurter'] The dual biography you're referring to is likely "The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President" by Willard Sterne Randall. The book covers the life of James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, and Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice.

Louis Brandeis was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1856, and he served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1916 until his death in 1941. He is known for his advocacy of progressive and liberal policies, and his opinions on issues such as free speech, privacy, and the role of the judiciary continue to be influential to this day.

James Madison, on the other hand, was born in Port Conway, Virginia in 1751 and served as the fourth President of the United States from 1809 to 1817. He is often referred to as the "Father of the Constitution" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution, and he is also known for his leadership during the War of 1812 and his support for the Bill of Rights.

The third person mentioned in the dual biography is likely James Monroe, who was born in Monroe Hall, Virginia in 1758 and served as the fifth President of the United States from 1817 to 1825. Monroe was a close friend and ally of Madison, and the two men worked together to acquire the Louisiana Territory and establish the principles of American foreign policy known as the Monroe Doctrine.

So, to summarize, the dual biography covers the lives of Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, and James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, as well as James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States and a close friend and ally of Madison.
341 True ['atom'] The "Plum Pudding" model was a proposed model for the internal structure of atoms in the early 1900s. It was developed by physicist J.J. Thomson and was later replaced by the planetary model of the atom, which was developed by Ernest Rutherford.

The Plum Pudding model was based on the idea that atoms were composed of a positively charged sphere of matter (the "plum") with negative electrons embedded within it (the "pudding"). The electrons were thought to be randomly distributed throughout the positive sphere, much like raisins in a plum pudding.

However, this model was later found to be inadequate in explaining the results of experiments that involved the scattering of alpha particles (high-energy helium nuclei) off atoms. These experiments, performed by Ernest Rutherford and his team, showed that atoms had a small, dense nucleus at their center, which was surrounded by a cloud of electrons. This led to the development of the planetary model of the atom, in which the electrons orbit the nucleus like planets around a sun.
342 True ['Nikkei'] The Nikkei 225, also known as the Nikkei Stock Average, is Japan's leading stock market index.

Rudyard Kipling's birthplace, a large house called 'Mirror of the Sea,' was located in the Thane area of Bombay. The house was built by Kipling's father, Lockwood Kipling, who was a British artist and teacher. Unfortunately, the house was demolished in the 1970s to make way for a new residential complex, but a small plaque marks the spot where it once stood.

The Faculty of Fine Arts, MS University, Baroda, which is located nearby, is a leading institution for the study of fine arts, performing arts, and design in India. It was established in 1950 and has produced many renowned artists, designers, and performers over the years. The faculty offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs in various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and graphic design, among others.

So, while the exact location of Rudyard Kipling's birthplace is no longer extant, it's interesting to note that the place where he was born is now home to an institution that celebrates and promotes the arts, much like Kipling's own life and work.

"The unexpected is a potent weapon in the hands of a political leader. It is a quality that Mr. Roosevelt has cultivated with great success. He has a genius for doing the unexpected, for surprising his friends and foes alike, and the country at large. The dramatic is not without value in politics, and Mr. Roosevelt knows how to make the most of it."

McCormick goes on to suggest that Roosevelt's ability to create drama and excitement around his policies and actions has helped to distinguish him from other politicians and has contributed to his popularity with the public. She notes that Roosevelt's "unexpected" quality has been particularly effective in helping him to navigate the challenges of the Great Depression and to build support for his New Deal policies.

Overall, the article provides a fascinating glimpse into Roosevelt's leadership style and his ability to connect with the American people through his use of drama and communication. It suggests that Roosevelt's "unexpected" quality was a key factor in his political success and helped to set him apart from other leaders of his time.

353 True ['Haydn'] The music of Germany's anthem was not composed by an Austrian for the 1797 birthday of the Holy Roman Emperor. The melody of the German national anthem, also known as "Deutschlandlied," was composed by Joseph Haydn, an Austrian composer, in 1797, but it was not for the birthday of the Holy Roman Emperor.

Haydn composed the melody for a different purpose. He was commissioned by the Austrian government to write a piece of music that would be played during the celebrations of the Austrian Emperor Francis II's visit to Vienna. The piece was originally titled "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" (God save Francis the Emperor) and was intended as a tribute to the emperor.

The lyrics of the song were written by a German poet named August von Kotzebue, and they were meant to be a celebration of the emperor and the Austrian Empire. The song became popular throughout the German-speaking world and was later adopted as the national anthem of Germany.

So, while the melody of the German national anthem was composed by an Austrian, it was not for the birthday of the Holy Roman Emperor, but rather for a different purpose.
354 False ['Endorphins'] Sure! The hormone you're referring to is oxytocin, which is often referred to as the "cuddle hormone" or "love hormone." It's released during physical touch, including hugs, and it promotes feelings of relaxation, bonding, and well-being. Oxytocin is named in part for the drug oxymorphone, which is a semi-synthetic opioid that is derived from thebaine, a natural opiate found in opium poppies. The name "oxytocin" reflects its chemical structure, which includes a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a morphine (-morphin) group. So, while oxytocin isn't actually a narcotic itself, it does have a structural similarity to certain opioids and is named accordingly.

In some cases, occlusion can be a serious condition that requires medical attention, such as in the case of a heart attack or stroke.

There are various methods for treating occlusion, including medications to dissolve blood clots, surgery to remove blockages, and angioplasty, which involves using a balloon or stent to open up the blocked vessel.
