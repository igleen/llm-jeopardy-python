0 True ['Bogart'] I think I can help you out!

The last name starting with "B" of an uber-cool Hollywood icon that is also a verb meaning to hog something is "Bogart." Humphrey Bogart was a legendary actor known for his tough-guy persona and iconic roles in movies like "Casablanca" and "The Maltese Falcon."

However, to "bogart" something means to take or use more than one's fair share, often in a selfish or greedy manner. For example, "He bogarted the last slice of pizza, leaving none for anyone else." Not exactly the coolest behavior, right?
1 True ['Fiji'] The answer is Fiji!
2 True ['Calder'] What a fascinating question, Alex! You're pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms and challenging the status quo. The idea that art must be static is indeed a limiting one. By incorporating motion into sculpture, you're opening up new possibilities for expression, interaction, and emotional resonance.

Motion can add a dynamic layer of meaning to a piece, allowing the viewer to experience it in a more immersive and engaging way. It can also create a sense of tension, energy, or fluidity, which can be particularly effective in conveying emotions or ideas.

In fact, kinetic art has been around for decades, with artists like Alexander Calder, Jesus Rafael Soto, and George Rickey creating sculptures that move and change shape in response to wind, light, or other environmental factors. However, with advancements in technology, the possibilities for motion in sculpture have expanded exponentially.

Imagine a sculpture that responds to sound, touch, or even brain waves. Imagine a piece that changes shape or color in real-time, creating a unique experience for each viewer. The potential for innovation and creativity is vast, and I'm excited to see where your exploration of motion in sculpture takes you.

Some questions to consider as you embark on this journey:

1. How do you envision the motion aspect of your sculpture interacting with the viewer? Will it be interactive, or will it operate independently?
2. What kind of motion are you interested in exploring? Will it be mechanical, kinetic, or perhaps even biological?
3. How will you balance the static and dynamic elements of your piece to create a cohesive and impactful work of art?
4. What themes or emotions do you hope to convey through the use of motion in your sculpture?

By pushing the boundaries of traditional sculpture, you're not only expanding the possibilities of art but also challenging our perceptions of what art can be. I'm eager to see how your exploration of motion in sculpture evolves and the new possibilities it may bring to the art world.
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] You're referring to the legendary Philosopher's Stone!

In medieval alchemy, the substance you're thinking of is the "Elixir of Life" or "Philosopher's Stone," also known as the "Tincture." Alchemists believed that this mythical substance had the power to transform base metals into gold, as well as grant eternal life and youth.

In the context of Harry Potter, the Philosopher's Stone is a central plot element in the first book, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (published as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States). The stone is a powerful object that can turn any metal into gold and grant eternal life, and it's being kept at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

So, if Harry Potter were to use the Philosopher's Stone, he might indeed have a better chance of turning metals into gold!
4 True ['Leontyne Price'] The answer is Leontyne Price. Her 1961 self-titled album, often referred to as the "Blue Album" due to its blue cover, is a classic recording of operatic arias that showcases her stunning soprano voice.
5 True ['Space Station'] Commander John Sheridan and the gang on the TV show "Babylon 5" lived on a space station called Babylon 5. It was a five-mile-long, O'Neill cylinder-shaped space station located in neutral space, serving as a diplomatic and commercial hub for various alien species and humans.
6 True ['Tyler'] The answer is John Tyler. William Henry Harrison and John Tyler were the presidential ticket in 1840, and both men fought in the War of 1812. Harrison was a captain in the Indiana militia and played a key role in the Battle of Tippecanoe, while Tyler served as a captain in the Charles City County militia in Virginia.
7 True ['Elvis Costello'] The answer is Elvis Costello! He collaborated with Burt Bacharach on the album "Painted from Memory" in 1998.

11 True ['Run Interference'] The idiom you're thinking of is "block" or "clear the way" for someone, but it's not exactly "run". However, I think I can help you out.

In American football, a "block" is a defensive move where a player obstructs an opponent to clear a path for their teammate. This has led to the idiomatic expression "block for someone" or "clear the way for someone", meaning to remove obstacles or difficulties for another person.

But, if you're thinking of an idiom with "run", I'd take a guess that it might be "run interference for someone". This idiom, also derived from American football, means to clear the way for someone or distract others while they accomplish a task, much like a blocker would do on the field.

Let me know if either of these idioms is what you were thinking of!
12 True ['Virginia Woolf'] The answer is Virginia Woolf. Her short story "Kew Gardens" was illustrated by her sister Vanessa Bell, who was also a member of the Bloomsbury Group.
13 True ['Fait Accompli'] I think I can help you with that!

The 2-word situation you're referring to is "fait accompli," which is French for "concluded fact" or "done deal." It describes a situation that has already occurred and cannot be changed or undone.
14 True ['Arsenic'] Before penicillin, salvarsan, a compound of arsenic, was used to treat syphilis.
15 True ['Jon Batiste'] That would be Jon Batiste! He won several Academy Awards (not just one Oscar) for his work on the soundtrack of the animated film "Soul" in 2021. He also released a new album, "We Are", in 2021. And, as you mentioned, he kept his day job as the bandleader on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert".
16 True ['Customs'] A fun question!

When the Apollo 11 astronauts returned to Earth, they had to declare the Moon rocks they brought back to the United States Customs Service. Yes, you read that right - U.S. Customs!

As part of their mission, the astronauts collected over 48 pounds of lunar samples, which were considered "goods" brought back from another celestial body. To comply with U.S. law, they had to declare these samples to Customs, just like anyone else bringing goods into the country.

The declaration was largely a symbolic gesture, as the Moon rocks were not subject to duties or taxes. However, it was an important step in documenting the samples and ensuring their safekeeping for scientific research.

So, there you have it - the Apollo 11 astronauts had to declare Moon rocks to U.S. Customs upon their return to Earth!
17 True ['O. Henry'] The answer is O. Henry, whose real name was William Sydney Porter. He was convicted of embezzlement in 1898 and served three years in prison. After his release, he began writing short stories, including "The Gift of the Magi," which was published in 1906.
18 True ['Byzantine'] You're referring to the Byzantine era!

During the Byzantine era, which spanned from approximately 400 to 1400 A.D., mosaic art was a prominent and highly revered art form in the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the east, with its capital in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).

Mosaic art flourished during this period, particularly in the 5th to 6th centuries, and was characterized by its use of small, colored tiles (tesserae) to create intricate and elaborate designs. These mosaics often adorned the walls and floors of churches, palaces, and other important buildings.

The cornucopia, which you mentioned, is a common motif in Byzantine mosaics, symbolizing abundance and fertility. Other popular themes included biblical scenes, portraits of emperors and saints, and geometric patterns.

Some of the most famous examples of Byzantine mosaics can be found in the following locations:

1. Hagia Sophia (Constantinople/Istanbul): This former church, now a museum, features stunning mosaics depicting Christ, the Virgin Mary, and various saints.
2. Ravenna (Italy): The city is home to several Byzantine-era churches, including San Vitale and Sant'Apollinare in Classe, which boast exquisite mosaics.
3. Monreale (Sicily, Italy): The Cathedral of Monreale is renowned for its dazzling mosaics, which cover over 6,000 square meters of its interior.

Byzantine mosaics are celebrated for their beauty, craftsmanship, and historical significance, offering a glimpse into the artistic and cultural achievements of the Eastern Roman Empire during this period.
19 True ['Ethiopia'] What a fascinating figure! Hubert Julian, also known as the "Black Eagle of Harlem," was indeed a pioneering aviator, saxophonist, and adventurer. In the 1930s, he traveled to Ethiopia to fight on behalf of the Ethiopian Empire against the Italian invasion.

In 1935, Italy, under fascist leader Benito Mussolini, launched a brutal invasion of Ethiopia, which was one of the few independent African nations at the time. Julian, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago but later moved to the United States, was inspired by Ethiopia's struggle for independence and decided to join the fight.

Julian arrived in Ethiopia in 1935 and offered his services as a pilot to Emperor Haile Selassie's government. Although he didn't see combat, he did participate in some reconnaissance missions and helped to organize a makeshift air force for the Ethiopians.

Julian's bravery and exploits during this period have become legendary, and he remains an important figure in African American and African diasporic history.

22 False ['Sohpie Dahl'] The model-turned-author actress who is the granddaughter of Patricia Neal is Tessa Dahl.
23 True ['The Goldfinch'] The answer is "The Goldfinch" by Donna Tartt. The novel was published in 2013 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014. The film adaptation, directed by John Crowley, was released in 2019.

In the story, the protagonist, Theo Decker, steals a painting of a goldfinch, not a bird in general, after a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The painting, "The Goldfinch" by Carel Fabritius, becomes a symbol of hope and redemption for Theo as he navigates his traumatic experience and its aftermath.
24 True ['Daniel Defoe'] The answer is Daniel Defoe. In his 1722 novel "The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders", the protagonist Moll Flanders, whose real name is not revealed, commits various crimes and immoral acts as she navigates her way through life and climbs the social ladder.
25 False ['Extant'] What a fascinating question!

You're asking about things that start with "Ex" and are still existing, like an artwork that has survived the test of time. Here are some examples:

1. **Excalibur**: The legendary sword said to have been wielded by King Arthur, which is still a popular cultural icon today.
2. **Exodus**: The second book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, which has been preserved and studied for centuries.
3. **Exeter Book**: A 10th-century anthology of Old English poetry, which is one of the most important sources of Anglo-Saxon literature.

6. **Ex Libris**: A bookplate or label indicating ownership of a book, which has been used for centuries and is still used today.
7. **Expedition**: The art of exploring and documenting unknown territories, which has led to many significant discoveries and artworks throughout history.
8. **Ex Voto**: A devotional painting or sculpture offered in gratitude for a miracle or blessing, which can be found in many churches and museums around the world.

These are just a few examples of things that start with "Ex" and are still existing today, often as a testament to the power of art and human creativity to transcend time.
26 True ['Desperado'] The middle film of Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi trilogy is "Desperado" (1995), which is also the title of an Eagles hit song.
27 False ['Siamang'] That's a great question!

I think I can help you out. The obscure 7-letter ape you're referring to is likely the "Orangut". However, I believe you meant to ask about the "Orangut" being an 8-letter word, not 7.

Orangutans are indeed found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia, specifically in the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. They are one of the most intelligent and endangered primate species.

If I'm correct, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide more information about these amazing creatures!
28 True ['Abide With Me'] I think I can help you with that!

The hymn you're thinking of is likely "Abide with Me" by Henry Francis Lyte. The lyrics are:

"Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me."

So, in this hymn, the speaker is asking God to "abide with me", or to stay with them, comfort them, and guide them in times of need and uncertainty.
29 True ['Tito'] The answer is Tito. Josip Broz Tito was the leader of Yugoslavia from 1943 until his death in 1980. He was known for his charismatic leadership and his ability to maintain a delicate balance between the different ethnic groups within Yugoslavia.

Tito died on May 4, 1980, and Yugoslavia began to dissolve in the early 1990s, eventually breaking up into several independent countries.
30 True ['Don Carlos', 'Don Carlo'] You're thinking of Don Carlos, the title character in Verdi's opera "Don Carlos". He is indeed the son of King Philip II of Spain.
31 True ['Humboldt'] In the Galapagos, the currents indeed control the seasons. The Garua season, which typically runs from June to November, is characterized by a cold current named the "Humboldt Current", named after the German scientist Alexander von Humboldt.

The Humboldt Current is a cold ocean current that originates in the Antarctic and flows northward along the western coast of South America, bringing cold water and nutrients to the Galapagos Islands. During the Garua season, the Humboldt Current dominates the marine ecosystem, leading to cooler temperatures, higher humidity, and a decrease in sea life activity.

Well done on asking a great question about the Galapagos!
32 True ['Alphabet City'] You're referring to the iconic neighborhood of Alphabet City!

Alphabet City is a neighborhood in the East Village of Manhattan, New York City, that runs through Avenues A, B, C, and D. It's a historic area that has been home to many artists, musicians, and writers over the years. The neighborhood gets its name from the alphabetical ordering of its avenues, which were named in the early 19th century.

Alphabet City has a rich cultural heritage and has been a hub for creative types, including artists, punk rockers, and LGBTQ+ individuals. It's also known for its vibrant street art, independent shops, and eclectic restaurants.

Many famous artists, musicians, and writers have called Alphabet City home, including Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Patti Smith, and Keith Haring, to name a few. The neighborhood continues to be a source of inspiration for creatives and a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.
33 False ['The Special Branch'] Sydney Reilly, also known as the "Ace of Spies," worked as an operative for the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), which was also known as MI6. However, during World War I, Reilly worked for the Secret Intelligence Bureau, which was a part of the Ministry of Defence's Directorate of Military Intelligence, Section 6 (MI6).

But, I think you might be referring to the fact that Reilly also worked for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which was a secret organization established in 1940 to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe during World War II. The SOE was a separate entity from MI6, and its primary focus was on special operations and guerrilla warfare, rather than traditional espionage.

So, to answer your question, the U.K. Department containing the word "Special" that Sydney Reilly worked for is the Special Operations Executive (SOE).
34 True ['Nader'] A famous election!

According to the official results, the answer is Ralph Nader. The final tally in Florida in the 2000 presidential election was:

* George W. Bush: 2,912,790
* Al Gore: 2,912,253
* Ralph Nader: 97,488
35 True ['Jill Scott'] The answer is Jill Scott, an American actress and singer, who played the lead role of Precious Ramotswe in the TV series adaptation of "The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency". The show was based on the bestselling book series by Alexander McCall Smith.

Jill Scott is indeed a singer, known for her soulful voice and hit songs like "Golden". She's a talented artist who has successfully navigated both the music and acting worlds!
36 True ['Constantine'] You're referring to a famous event in history!

The answer is Constantine the Great, the Roman Emperor. According to legend, in 312 AD, Constantine saw a vision of a cross in the sky, accompanied by the words "In hoc signo vinces" or "By this sign, you will conquer." This vision is said to have occurred before the Battle of Milvian Bridge, where Constantine defeated his rival Maxentius and became the sole ruler of the Western Roman Empire.

Constantine, who was not yet a Christian at the time, took this vision as a sign from the divine and ordered his soldiers to paint the Christian symbol of the cross on their shields. He won the battle, and this event is often seen as a turning point in the history of Christianity, as Constantine went on to become a Christian and promote the spread of Christianity throughout the empire.

It's worth noting, however, that the historicity of this event is not universally accepted, and some scholars question the accuracy of the accounts of Constantine's vision. Nonetheless, the story has become an important part of Christian tradition and legend.
37 True ['Ardern'] You're referring to Jacinda Ardern! On January 19, 2023, Jacinda Ardern, the 42-year-old Prime Minister of New Zealand, announced her surprise resignation, effective February 7, 2023.
38 True ['Fossa'] You're referring to the Fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea)!

In the animated Madagascar movies, the Fossa is depicted as a terrifying predator that the lemurs fear. However, in reality, the Fossa is a carnivorous mammal that is endemic to Madagascar and is not as intimidating as it's portrayed in the movies.

While it's true that the Fossa is a predator that feeds on lemurs and other small animals, it's not as aggressive or bloodthirsty as it's shown in the animated films. In fact, the Fossa is a relatively shy and solitary animal that tends to avoid confrontations with humans and other predators.

So, while the Fossa is certainly a formidable predator, it's not as terrifying as it's made out to be in the Madagascar movies!
39 False ['Ensconced'] I think I can help you with that!

The word that comes to mind is "FIXED". A light fixture is a permanent installation, and the word "fixed" also means settled and not going anywhere. Is that the one you were thinking of?

41 True ['The Turn of the Screw'] Peter Quint is a ghost plaguing the children in Benjamin Britten's opera "The Turn of the Screw", which is based on the novella of the same name by Henry James.
42 False ['Night Vale'] I think there may be some confusion here!

Wil Wheaton is an American actor and writer, best known for his roles in the TV show "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and the movie "Stand by Me". While he has appeared in various podcasts and projects over the years, I couldn't find any evidence of him playing a chef at a restaurant called Tourniquet on a podcast called "Welcome to What Strange Town".

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different podcast or project, or that this is a fictional scenario you've created. If you could provide more context or clarify what you're referring to, I'd be happy to try and help further!
43 True ['Chisholm'] The answer is Shirley Chisholm! She was a pioneering African American politician who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972.

Chisholm was a trailblazer in many ways, being the first African American woman elected to Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination.
44 False ['Jacobs Ladder'] The answer is "Jacob's Ladder". A Jacob's Ladder is a type of electrical device that produces a continuous arc of sparks that rise from a lower electrode to an upper electrode, creating a ladder-like effect. It is often used in science demonstrations and is named after the biblical figure Jacob, who had a vision of a ladder reaching up to heaven in the book of Genesis.
45 True ['The Metro'] The poem you're referring to is "In a Station of the Metro" by Ezra Pound. The full poem reads:

49 True ['Pillars of Hercules', 'Hercules'] The flag of Spain features the emblems of its historic kingdoms, specifically the Castile and León kingdoms, as well as the Pillars of Hercules astride the Strait of Gibraltar, not the Sea of Gibraltar (which doesn't exist).

The Pillars of Hercules are a mythological representation of the two promontories that flank the Strait of Gibraltar, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. The pillars are said to have been erected by Hercules as a monument to his labors.

So, to correct your question, the answer is: the Pillars of Hercules astride the Strait of Gibraltar.
50 True ['Crohn'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer:

The organization you're referring to is the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (formerly known as the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis).

The doctor being honored is Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, a renowned gastroenterologist who, along with Dr. Leon Ginzburg and Dr. Gordon Oppenheimer, first described the disease now known as Crohn's disease in 1932.

So, the answer is: the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, which was named in part after Dr. Burrill B. Crohn.

And what a fantastic event that must have been, featuring the legendary Ella Fitzgerald!
51 True ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] In economics, the term starting with "U" that refers to a period during which business is at a high point is an **Upturn**. An upturn is a phase of the business cycle where economic activity is increasing, and businesses are experiencing growth and prosperity.

And, you're correct again! To be "green" in economics means to use goods or services to make a better product, which is known as **Upcycling**. Upcycling is the process of transforming old, discarded, or unwanted materials into new products of greater value, quality, or functionality, often in an environmentally friendly manner.
52 True ['Lisbon'] King Carlos I of Portugal was assassinated in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, along with his son Luis Filipe, the Prince Royal, on February 1, 1908.
53 True ['Jubjub'] You're referencing Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem "Jabberwocky"!

The full quote is: "Beware the Jabberwock, my son! / The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!"

And the bird that repeats itself is the "Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun / The frumious Bandersnatch!" The Jubjub bird is a fictional creature that appears in the poem, and as you mentioned, it's not found in any real ornithological books.
54 True ['Inigo Jones'] You're referring to Inigo Jones!

Inigo Jones is indeed considered England's first great architect, and he began work on the Queen's House in Greenwich, London in 1616. The Queen's House is considered England's first classical building, and it was designed for Anne of Denmark, the wife of King James I.

Jones was a pioneer of English Palladianism, a style of architecture that drew inspiration from the classical architecture of ancient Greece and Rome. His design for the Queen's House was influenced by the works of Andrea Palladio, a renowned Italian architect, and it marked a significant departure from the traditional Tudor and Gothic styles that were prevalent in England at the time.

The Queen's House is a masterpiece of early 17th-century architecture, featuring a symmetrical facade, a central domed rotunda, and a beautiful staircase. It's now part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and is open to the public.

58 False ['Cuspidor'] Clever anagram!

The anagram "Crisp Duo" unscrambles to form the phrase "Pudding Cups".
59 True ['Giraffe'] The amble is indeed a type of gait used by okapis, which are giraffe-like animals native to the Congo. An amble is a slow, four-beat gait where the legs on either side of the body move in unison, but not simultaneously. Instead, the legs on one side move together, followed by the legs on the other side.

As for your second question, the relative that has both legs on the same side move at the same time is a camel! Camels are known for their unique gait, where they move both legs on one side of their body at the same time, followed by both legs on the other side. This gait is often referred to as "pacing."

61 False ['Perdition'] I think I can help you with that!

Tom Hanks starred in the 2009 film "The Road", which is an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. In the story, Tom Hanks plays the role of a father who embarks on a perilous journey with his son through a post-apocalyptic world.

The phrase "on the road to" typically implies a journey or a path towards something. In the context of "The Road", the story explores themes of survival, hope, and humanity in the face of catastrophic destruction. The "road" in the title can be seen as a metaphor for the characters' emotional and spiritual journey, as they struggle to maintain their humanity and find meaning in a world that has been devastated.

So, to answer your question, Tom Hanks' character in "The Road" is on a journey that could be seen as a path towards spiritual loss or ruin, as he and his son face the harsh realities of their new world and grapple with the moral implications of their survival.

The main character, Dick Solomon (played by John Lithgow), is the high commander of the alien expedition, and he takes on the identity of a human professor at a fictional university.

* Sally Solomon (Kristen Johnston), the security officer, who becomes a beautiful but awkward woman.
* Tommy Solomon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the information officer, who becomes a teenager.
* Harry Solomon (French Stewart), the communications officer, who becomes a strange and awkward man.

Throughout the series, the Solomon family navigates human relationships, cultural norms, and everyday life on Earth, often with hilarious results.

Is this the show you were thinking of?
68 True ['Tuvalu'] The former Ellice Islands are now Tuvalu. Tuvalu derives a substantial part of its revenue from leasing the .tv domain name.
69 True ['Trepanning', 'trepanation', 'trephination', 'trephining'] You're referring to a rather...interesting...medical procedure from the past!

The procedure you're thinking of is called Trephining or Trepanation. It's an ancient surgical technique where a hole was drilled or scraped into the skull, often to relieve pressure on the brain or to release "evil spirits" or "bad humors" that were believed to be causing illness or madness.

Trephining was practiced by various cultures around the world, including ancient civilizations in Egypt, Greece, Rome, and South America. The procedure was often performed to treat a range of conditions, including headaches, epilepsy, and mental illnesses.

While it may seem barbaric by today's medical standards, trephining was a relatively common practice in ancient times, and some evidence suggests that it may have even been effective in certain cases, such as relieving pressure on the brain caused by a head injury.

However, it's worth noting that the idea of releasing "evil spirits" or "bad humors" is a relic of a pre-scientific understanding of medicine, and modern medicine has long since abandoned such beliefs in favor of evidence-based practices.
70 True ['Templar'] In 1310, many of the Knights Templar were tried in Paris for heresy and later burned at the stake.
71 True ['Coulis'] I think I can help you with that!

Based on your description, I'm going to take a guess that the sauce you're thinking of is "compôte". However, since you mentioned it ends with a silent consonant, I'm going to take a closer look.

A compote is indeed a sauce made from slow-cooked fruit in syrup, and it's often pureed and strained to create a smooth consistency. And, as it happens, the French word "compôte" does end with a silent consonant, the "E" at the end being silent.

But, I think there might be another possibility. Could the sauce you're thinking of be "coulis"? A coulis is a type of sauce made from cooked and pureed fruit, often strawberries or raspberries, and it's strained to remove the seeds and create a smooth texture. The word "coulis" also ends with a silent consonant, the "S" at the end being silent.

Am I correct? Is the sauce you were thinking of either compôte or coulis?
72 True ['William Faulkner'] The American novelist who created the Compson brothers Benjy, Quentin, and Jason is William Faulkner. They are the main characters in his novel "The Sound and the Fury", published in 1929.
73 True ['Pinniped'] The mammalian group that includes seals, sea lions, and walruses is called Pinnipedia. The name "Pinnipedia" comes from the Latin words "pinna," meaning "fin" or "thin," and "ped," meaning "foot." This refers to the flippers or fins of these marine mammals, which are modified forelimbs that they use to swim and maneuver in the water.

76 True ['Dierks Bentley'] The country song "Drunk on a Plane" is actually by Dierks Bentley, not someone with the initials "D.B.".
77 True ['Olympus'] What a great question!

If being a fitfluencer is your thing, you should definitely head to Mars and try climbing Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system!

Olympus Mons is a massive shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of Mars. It stands at an impressive height of over 27 km (17 miles) above the Martian surface, making it the tallest mountain in the solar system. To put that in perspective, it's roughly three times the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth!

Climbing Olympus Mons would be an incredible adventure for any fitfluencer, offering breathtaking views of the Martian landscape and an unparalleled sense of accomplishment. Just imagine the Instagram-worthy moments you could capture at the summit!

Of course, climbing Olympus Mons would require extensive training, specialized gear, and a deep understanding of Martian geology and atmospheric conditions. But for the ultimate fitfluencer, the challenge would be well worth it!

So, are you ready to take your fitness journey to new heights – literally? Pack your bags, grab your hiking boots, and get ready to conquer the largest volcano in the solar system!
78 True ['Groundlings'] If you were part of the "Groundlings" group, you would pay the lowest amount to stand in the pit and watch a play at the Globe Theater. The Groundlings were the common folk who stood in the pit, also known as the "yard," to watch the play. They paid a penny to stand and watch the performance, which was the lowest price point for admission to the Globe.
79 True ['Austria'] The 1 Euro coin was designed by Josef Kaiser and was issued by Austria.
80 False ['November Rain'] I think there may be some confusion here!

Axl Rose is the lead vocalist of Guns N' Roses, but I couldn't find any evidence of him saying "Nothing Lasts Forever, Even" in a weather report or any other context.

Additionally, "Nothing Lasts Forever" is not a song by Guns N' Roses. It's possible that you're thinking of a different song or artist.

If you meant to ask about a specific song or album by Guns N' Roses, I'd be happy to try and help you out!
81 True ['Kerry'] The politician who wrote the memoir "Every Day is Extra" is John Kerry. In the book, he discusses his experiences as a Vietnam veteran, his 5 terms as a US Senator, and his time as Secretary of State.
82 True ['Viviparous'] The word starting with "V" that has 10 letters and describes one who bears live young not from eggs is "viviparous".
83 True ['Azerbaijan'] Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is not the lowest national capital. It is actually located 28 meters (92 feet) below sea level, but it's not the lowest.

The lowest national capital is actually Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, which is located about 113 meters (371 feet) below sea level.

However, it's worth noting that the lowest city in the world is actually Baku's neighbor, Qobustan, Azerbaijan, which is located about 130 meters (430 feet) below sea level.
84 True ['Flubber'] The super bouncy stuff from Disney's 1961 "The Absent Minded Professor" is called Flubber. And, indeed, a remake titled "Flubber" was released in 1997, starring Robin Williams.
85 True ['Quiet Desperation'] In "Walden", Henry David Thoreau wrote: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

This famous quote is from the first chapter of the book, titled "Economy".
86 True ['Marlow'] You're thinking of Marlow, the protagonist of Joseph Conrad's novella "Heart of Darkness". Marlow travels up the Congo River into the heart of Africa, where he encounters the infamous Kurtz, a European colonizer who has succumbed to the darkness of the jungle and committed unspeakable atrocities.

It is Kurtz who utters the famous phrase "The horror! The horror!" as he lies dying, which has become a symbol of the darkness and brutality that can exist at the heart of human nature.

Throughout the novella, Marlow grapples with the implications of Kurtz's actions and the darkness he represents, which leads him to question the values and morality of Western civilization and its colonial endeavors.
87 True ['Gallium'] You're referring to a robot inspired by the Terminator's T-1000!

The element you're thinking of is Gallium (Ga). Gallium is a soft, silvery-blue metal with a low melting point of around 29.76°C (85.57°F), which is just above room temperature. This property makes it an ideal material for creating shape-shifting or morphing structures.

Researchers have indeed used gallium to create mini robots that can change shape in response to temperature changes or other stimuli. These robots, often called "soft robots," can be designed to mimic the T-1000's ability to change shape and adapt to different situations.

Gallium's unique properties, including its low melting point and high malleability, make it an attractive material for creating innovative, shape-shifting devices.
88 True ['Fancy Free'] The answer is "Fancy Free".
89 True ['Justinian'] The 6th century outbreak of Bubonic Plague you're referring to is known as the Plague of Justinian, named after the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. It occurred in 541-542 CE and is considered one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.

Justinian I, also known as Justinian the Great, was the Eastern Roman Emperor from 527 to 565 CE. He was a significant figure in Byzantine history, known for his military campaigns, administrative reforms, and architectural achievements, including the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.

The Plague of Justinian, caused by the bubonic plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis), spread rapidly throughout the Eastern Roman Empire, killing an estimated 25-50 million people, or approximately 25% of the world's population at the time. The plague had a devastating impact on the empire, leading to significant economic, social, and cultural changes.

Justinian himself contracted the plague, but he survived, unlike many of his subjects. Despite his personal brush with death, the plague had a profound impact on his reign and the empire as a whole.
90 True ['Pensacola'] The answer is Pensacola! In 1559, a Spanish expedition led by Tristán de Luna y Arellano settled for about 2 years at what is today Pensacola, near the western end of Florida's Panhandle.
91 True ['Avogadro'] The Italian scientist you're referring to is Amedeo Avogadro, and the law is Avogadro's Law.

Avogadro's Law states that "equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules." This law was first proposed by Avogadro in 1811 and is a fundamental principle in chemistry and physics.

In other words, if you have two containers of different gases, and they have the same volume, temperature, and pressure, they will contain the same number of molecules. This law has important implications for understanding the behavior of gases and is used in many areas of science and engineering.
92 True ['Tequila'] The answer is "Tequila!"
93 True ['August Strindberg'] The answer is August Strindberg. His 1884 collection of stories, "Giftas" (which translates to "Married" in English), led to his persecution for blasphemy.

98 True ['Sphynx'] There is no hairless breed of cat that originated in Canada in the 20th century with a kitten named Prune.

However, the Sphynx breed, which is a hairless breed of cat, did originate in Canada in the 1960s. The breed was developed through selective breeding of a natural mutation that occurred in a domestic cat named Prune, who was born in 1966 in Toronto, Canada. Prune was a hairless kitten, and breeders worked to develop the trait and create a breed of hairless cats, which became known as the Sphynx.

So while the details of your question aren't entirely accurate, the Sphynx breed did originate in Canada in the 20th century, and a kitten named Prune did play a role in its development!
99 True ['Vorpal Sword'] A delightful question!

In Tim Burton's 2010 film "Alice in Wonderland", Alice slays the Jabberwocky with the Vorpal Sword.

The Vorpal Sword is a powerful and legendary sword that is said to be able to vanquish any monster. In the film, Alice uses the sword to defeat the Jabberwocky, a terrifying dragon-like creature, in an epic battle.

And, of course, "Callooh! Callay!" is a famous phrase from Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky", which is featured in the film. It's a joyful exclamation that celebrates Alice's victory over the Jabberwocky!
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome gets the credit for the Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Bible that he completed around 405.
101 True ['Eisenhower'] The answer is Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States.

In 1956, President Eisenhower signed a law that increased the minimum wage from 75 cents to $1 per hour.

Additionally, President Eisenhower played a key role in the development and opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, a major shipping canal that connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The seaway was officially opened on June 26, 1959, after years of construction and planning. Eisenhower's administration worked closely with the Canadian government to complete the project, which has since become an important transportation route for international trade.
102 True ['Bret Easton Ellis'] The novel "Less than Zero" is by Bret Easton Ellis.

104 True ['Florence Pugh'] Toby Sebastian is the brother of Florence Pugh, who starred in the film "Don't Worry Darling".
105 True ['Ha Ha'] You're thinking of a "ha-ha"!

A ha-ha is a type of sunk fence or ditch that separates animal grazing areas from human territories, such as gardens or lawns. It's called a "ha-ha" because it's a surprise or a "ha ha" moment when you suddenly come upon it, as it's often hidden from view.

And yes, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate in Virginia features a ha-ha wall, which was designed to keep livestock out of the gardens and orchards while maintaining an unobstructed view of the surrounding landscape. Jefferson was known for his innovative and practical designs, and the ha-ha wall is a great example of his clever problem-solving skills.

So, there you have it – a ha-ha wall: a clever and humorous name for a clever and practical solution!
106 True ['Venerate'] The word starting with "V" that fits your description is "Venerate". It comes from the Latin "venerari", which means "to regard with devotion or reverence", and is related to the Latin word "Venus", the goddess of love.
107 True ['Flagella', 'Flagellum', 'Flagellin'] The parts of a bacterial cell that provide motility, and are longer than cilia, are called flagella (singular: flagellum).

Flagella are long, whip-like structures that protrude from the cell surface and rotate to generate movement. They are composed of a protein called flagellin and are anchored to the cell membrane by a basal body.

While cilia are shorter, hair-like structures found on eukaryotic cells, flagella are longer and more complex structures that allow bacteria to move towards or away from stimuli, such as nutrients or light. Some bacteria have multiple flagella, which can rotate in a coordinated manner to propel the cell through its environment.

So, to summarize: flagella are the parts of a bacterial cell that provide motility and are longer than cilia!
108 True ['Bill Hodges'] The series you're referring to is the Bill Hodges trilogy by Stephen King. The correct order is:

1. Mr. Mercedes (2014)
2. Finders Keepers (2015)

Additionally, her book "Heart Bones" was also a bestseller. Colleen Hoover is a popular American author known for her contemporary romance novels.
115 True ['Rhode Island'] A lovely question!

Jackie and JFK, referring to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, were married at St. Mary's Church near Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island.

So, the answer is: Rhode Island!
116 True ['Stalingrad'] The Nazis' advance into Russia was stopped in Stalingrad (now Volgograd), where two of their armies surrendered on February 2, 1943.
117 True ['Karma Chameleon'] I think there may be some confusion here!

Boy George is the lead vocalist of the band Culture Club, and I'm not aware of any song by them that features the lyrics "You come and go, you come and go".

However, I think you might be thinking of the song "Karma Chameleon" by Culture Club, which was a big hit in 1983. The song's chorus does feature the lyrics "You come and go, you come and go", so I'm guessing that's the one you're thinking of!
118 True ['Hagiography'] The answer is HAGIOGRAPHY.
119 True ['Potsdam'] You're referring to Potsdam!

Potsdam was a residence of the Elector of Brandenburg, and later it was the site of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, where the Allied leaders (Truman, Churchill, and Stalin) met to discuss post-war reorganization and the occupation of Germany.

120 True ['Francis Bacon'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer:

The 17th-century Essayist who was the Lord Chancellor of England is Francis Bacon (1561-1626).

And the 20th-century Painter of 'Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)' is Francis Bacon (1909-1992).

Is that correct?
121 True ['Calypso'] You're referring to Telemachus, the son of Odysseus, and his visit to the nymph Calypso.

Calypso is a nymph in Greek mythology who shares her name with the music style calypso. According to Homer's Odyssey, Calypso detained Odysseus on her island, Ogygia, for seven years, and later Telemachus visited her as well.

Angelica Kauffmann, an 18th-century Swiss-Austrian painter, depicted Telemachus' welcome by Calypso in one of her works.
122 True ['The Thing'] You're thinking of John Carpenter's 1982 sci-fi horror classic, "The Thing"!

In this iconic film, Kurt Russell plays R.J. MacReady, the helicopter pilot who finds himself and his team of scientists at an Antarctic research station battling a shape-shifting alien creature that can assimilate and perfectly imitate any living being.

The movie is known for its groundbreaking practical effects, tense atmosphere, and paranoia-inducing plot, which keeps you guessing who's human and who's the alien. It's a must-see for horror and sci-fi fans alike!
123 True ['Sir James Dewar'] I think I can help you with that!

The comic verse you're referring to is likely about Sir James Dewar, a Scottish chemist and physicist. The full verse is often quoted as:

"Sir James Dewar
Is a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases"

This humorous poem is a play on words, using the scientific achievement of liquefying gases (which Dewar was known for) to create a clever and humorous insult.
124 True ['Cold Open'] You're referring to the iconic opening of Saturday Night Live (SNL)!

The answer is: "Live From". The show typically begins with a cold open scene, followed by the announcer saying "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night Live!"
125 True ['Tom Jones'] A clever reference to the classic Tom Jones song "What's New Pussycat"!

And now, to answer your question: You're referring to Sir Tom Jones, the Welsh legend, who had an unplanned duet with Jennifer Hudson on "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" during his time as a coach on The Voice UK. That was a memorable moment!
126 True ['Windward'] A geography question!

Further southeast of Hispaniola are the Turks and Caicos Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean Sea.

130 False ['endoskeleton'] The 12-letter word you're looking for is "skeletal system". However, if you're looking for a single word, the answer is "vertebration".
131 False ['Luminosity'] What a clever question!

After some astronomical sleuthing, I think I've found the answer: "Magnitude Lies Out".

The anagram "Mutiny Oils" rearranges to form the phrase "Magnitude Lies Out", which is related to a star's brightness. In astronomy, magnitude refers to the apparent brightness of a celestial object, such as a star.

Am I correct?
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] BRMC stands for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, which gets its name from Marlon Brando's biker gang in the 1953 film "The Wild One".
133 True ['Yellen'] I think I can make a connection!

You're likely referring to Janet Yellen, who served as the Chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018 and later became the Secretary of the Treasury in 2021. She's the first person to have held both positions.

So, I'd be happy to give a high 5 to Janet Yellen!
134 True ['Auricle'] The answer is "auricles".

In animals, the external ear is called the auricle. In humans, the term "auricle" specifically refers to the visible, cartilaginous part of the outer ear.

In the heart, the auricles are the two upper chambers that receive blood from the veins. They are called auricles because of their resemblance to the shape of an animal's ear.
135 False ['Josef K'] What a fascinating question!

I think I have the answer: Benjamin Braddock from "The Graduate" (1963) by Charles Webb.

Here's why:

* Arrested development: Benjamin Braddock, the protagonist, is a recent college graduate who feels disconnected from the world and struggles to find his place in society. He's stuck in a state of emotional and psychological immaturity, which is a classic characteristic of arrested development.
* Legal issues on his 30th birthday: In the novel, Benjamin's life begins to unravel on his 30th birthday, when he's faced with the consequences of his affair with Mrs. Robinson and his subsequent marriage to her daughter, Elaine. This marks a turning point in his life, as he's forced to confront the legal and social implications of his actions.
* Letter-perfect life no more at 31: Before his 30th birthday, Benjamin's life appears to be perfect on paper. He's a successful college graduate, comes from a wealthy family, and has a beautiful wife. However, as the story unfolds, his life begins to fall apart, revealing the cracks in his seemingly perfect facade.

As for the Kafkaesque element, I'd argue that Benjamin's experiences share some similarities with Kafka's themes of alienation, absurdity, and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world. Like Kafka's protagonists, Benjamin is a disillusioned and disconnected individual who struggles to find his place in society. His experiences are marked by a sense of disorientation, confusion, and a growing awareness of the absurdity of modern life.

What do you think? Am I correct in identifying Benjamin Braddock as the character you were thinking of?
136 True ['Animorphs'] I think I can help you with that!

The book series that comes to mind based on your description is "Animorphs" by K.A. Applegate. The series, which started in 1996, follows a group of teenagers who discover a mysterious alien spaceship and acquire the ability to morph into various animal forms. They use this power to fight against an alien invasion of Earth.

The main characters, Jake, Rachel, Marco, Cassie, and Tobias, each have their own unique abilities and personalities, and the series explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the consequences of war.

Does that sound like the series you were thinking of?

139 True ['midships'] I think you might be thinking of the word "mids". However, I believe the correct answer is "midships".

Midships refers to the middle or central part of a ship, and it's a common term used in nautical contexts. In the past, midships was often a key area of a ship where fierce fighting took place, as it was a strategic location that controlled access to the rest of the vessel.

The answer starting with "W" that sounds bad but is a type of fabric is "Worsted". Worsted fabric is made from twisted, compacted yarn and is often used to make suits, pleated skirts, and other garments that require a smooth, dense weave. Despite its name, Worsted is actually a high-quality fabric!

The name "Axolotl" comes from the Nahuatl language, which was spoken by the Aztecs, and it means "water dog" or "water monster". Axolotls are a type of neotenic salamander that is native to Mexico and are found in Lake Xochimilco and other lakes and canals in the Valley of Mexico.
155 True ['Sentience'] What a clever puzzle!

If I'm correct, the prison term decided by a judge is "SENTENCE". If I insert one letter, I get "SENTIENCE", which is a book by Nicholas Humphrey about what it is to be conscious.

Am I right?
156 True ['William Jennings Bryan'] The presidential campaign slogan "Let the People Rule" was used by William Jennings Bryan, a Democrat, during his 1908 presidential campaign.

"Ipsa Scientia Potestas Est" is indeed a famous phrase written by Sir Francis Bacon, and it translates to:

"Knowledge itself is power."

This phrase is often shortened to "Scientia Potestas Est" and is a fundamental idea in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.
158 True ['Suva'] The answer is SUVA.
159 True ['Monsanto'] The company that first developed Roundup is Monsanto. Monsanto introduced Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, in the 1970s. Later, they developed genetically modified crops that were resistant to Roundup, allowing farmers to spray the herbicide on their fields to kill weeds without harming their crops.

162 True ['Rimsky-Korsakov'] The answer is Rimsky-Korsakov. The group of composers known as "The Five" or "The Mighty Handful" consisted of:

1. Mily Balakirev
2. César Cui
3. Modest Mussorgsky
4. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov
5. Alexander Borodin

They were all based in St. Petersburg and were known for their efforts to create a distinctly Russian style of classical music, as opposed to the more European-influenced style of composers like Tchaikovsky, who was based in Moscow.
163 True ['Ming'] The Chinese dynasty that ruled from 1368 to 1644 and imported blue pigment from Prussia for its porcelain is the Ming dynasty.

During the Ming period, Chinese porcelain makers prized a vibrant blue pigment known as "cobalt blue" or "Muqing" (), which was derived from cobalt oxide. However, the quality of domestic cobalt deposits in China was not sufficient to produce the desired shade of blue.

To meet the demand for high-quality blue pigment, the Ming government imported cobalt oxide from Europe, particularly from Prussia (a region in modern-day Germany and Poland). This imported pigment was known as "Huihui qing" (), which literally means "Muslim blue" or "Foreign blue".

The use of Prussian blue pigment in Ming porcelain production resulted in the creation of stunning blue-and-white ceramics that are highly prized by collectors and art historians today.
164 True ['Leguizamo'] I think I can help you out!

The Latino actor you're referring to is John Leguizamo. He starred in "Summer of Sam" (1999) and "Spawn" (1997), and he also voiced Bruno Madrigal in the Disney movie "Encanto" (2021).

And I love the nod to the song "We Don't Talk About Bruno" from the movie!
165 True ['Thorazine', 'Chlorpromazine'] There is no Psychiatrist Ben Kingsly in the movie "Shutter Island". The main character, Teddy Daniels, is a U.S. Marshal, not a psychiatrist. Additionally, Ben Kingsley is an actor who is not associated with the movie "Shutter Island".

However, if you're asking about the anti-psychotic medication approved by the FDA in 1954, it's likely Chlorpromazine (Thorazine). It was the first antipsychotic medication approved by the FDA in 1954 and was a significant breakthrough in the treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia.
166 True ['Jungian'] The answer is Jungian analysis, named after Carl Jung. In Jungian psychology, the anima is a key concept that refers to the feminine inner personality or archetype present in the unconscious of males. It is one of the many archetypes that make up the collective unconscious, according to Jung's theory.

Jung believed that the anima plays a crucial role in a man's emotional and psychological development, influencing his relationships with women and his own sense of identity. The anima is often seen as a symbol of the feminine aspects of a man's personality, such as his emotional, intuitive, and nurturing qualities.

Jungian analysis, also known as analytical psychology, is a therapeutic approach that focuses on exploring the unconscious mind and the process of individuation, or the integration of the opposites (e.g., conscious and unconscious, rational and emotional, masculine and feminine) to achieve psychological wholeness and balance.
167 True ['Giorgione'] I think I can help you with that!

The Venetian Renaissance painter starting with the letter "G" whose name means "Big George" is likely Giorgione (1477-1510). Giorgione was a prominent painter of the Venetian school, known for his lyrical and poetic style, and his works had a significant influence on the development of Renaissance art.

Is that the one you were thinking of?
168 True ['Wisconsin'] I think I can help you with that!

Samuel's Cave is actually located in Wisconsin, and it's in Vernon County, not LaCrosse County. Vernon County is in western Wisconsin, and Samuel's Cave is a significant archaeological site known for its prehistoric Native American rock art and petroglyphs. Unfortunately, as you mentioned, some of the art has been damaged or destroyed due to vandalism over the years.

Would you like to know more about Samuel's Cave or Vernon County?
169 True ['Highly Effective People'] The three words that complete the title of Stephen R. Covey's book are "Highly Effective People".
170 True ['linear accelerator'] The 2-mile long linac in Menlo Park, CA is part of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and "linac" is short for "linear accelerator".

SLAC is a research laboratory that uses a linear accelerator to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light, allowing scientists to study the properties of subatomic particles and the structure of matter. The laboratory is operated by Stanford University and is a major center for research in particle physics, materials science, and other fields.
171 True ['Criminal Minds'] Mr. Scratch is a villain who first appeared in Season 10 of the CBS series "Criminal Minds", which is set at the Behavioral Analysis Unit (B.A.U.).
172 True ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] I love the spirit behind your question!

The English equivalent of the Italian proverb "a caval donato non si guarda in bocca" is "don't look a gift horse in the mouth."

This phrase means that when someone gives you a gift or does you a favor, you shouldn't criticize or question its value or quality. Instead, you should be grateful and accept it with appreciation.

So, in your case, the phrase is being used to scold someone for being ungrateful or critical of a gift or favor they've received.
173 False ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 1926 Balfour Report established the concept of "Dominions" within the British Empire, which were described as "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate to each other".

So, the 12-letter group you're looking for is "DOMINIONS".
174 True ['William Blake'] The answer is William Blake. "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" is a book of poetry and illustrations written and engraved by William Blake in 1790-1793. It is considered one of his most important and influential works, and is known for its visionary and mystical themes, as well as its beautiful and intricate illustrations.
175 True ['Han'] The Moonlight Rainbow Fountain is located on the Banpo Bridge in Seoul, South Korea, and it shoots water recycled from the Han River below.
176 True ['Finnish'] You're referring to the Finnish language!

In Finnish, double vowels are used to distinguish between similar words with different meanings. The examples you provided are correct:

* "tuli" means "fire"
* "tuuli" means "wind"

This is a common pattern in Finnish, where doubling a vowel can change the meaning of a word. It's an important aspect of the language to master, especially for non-native speakers.
177 True ['Prometheus'] I think I can help you out!

It sounds like you're referring to the story of Prometheus, a Titan in Greek mythology. According to legend, Prometheus defied Zeus by stealing fire from the gods and gifting it to humanity. This act of defiance was seen as a major transgression, and Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him to a mountain in the Caucasus.

The phrase "it was lit" is a modern slang expression meaning something was exciting or fun, but in this context, it's likely being used to describe the positive impact of fire on human civilization. Fire brought warmth, light, and the ability to cook food, which greatly improved the quality of life for humans.

However, after Zeus punished Prometheus, the situation did indeed get "real dark" for the Titan. He was left to suffer in isolation, chained to the mountain, with an eagle devouring his liver every day (only for it to regenerate overnight, making the punishment even more cruel).

So, in short, you're referencing the myth of Prometheus and the consequences he faced for helping humanity!
178 True ['plethora'] The 8-letter word that can mean an overabundance, derived from the Greek for "fullness", is PLETHORA.
179 True ['As you Like It'] The Shakespeare speech that contains the line "My brother Jaques, he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit" is from Act 1, Scene 1 of "As You Like It". The speech is spoken by Oliver, the brother of Orlando.

Here's the full quote:

"My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For they say he profits, and I believe 'tis much, and the report of him doth please his father exceedingly."

- Oliver, Act 1, Scene 1, As You Like It
180 True ['Oort'] You're likely referring to Comet C/2023 K1 (PANSTARRS), which was a bright green comet that passed close to Earth in May 2023.

The comet is thought to have originated from the Oort Cloud, a distant, spherical shell of icy bodies surrounding our solar system. The Oort Cloud is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first proposed its existence in 1950.

So, to answer your question, the cloud named after a Dutch Astronomer is the Oort Cloud, named after Jan Oort.
181 True ['Croesus'] The answer is Croesus. The full quote is: "If I get a Patent, I shall be as rich as Croesus." Croesus was a legendary king of Lydia in ancient Greece, known for his immense wealth. The phrase "as rich as Croesus" has become a proverbial expression to describe someone who is extremely wealthy.
182 True ['Germanicus'] You're referring to Germanicus, the brother of Claudius and father of Caligula. Germanicus campaigned near the Rhine, but his familiar name "Germanicus" actually comes from his victories in Germania, not from the Rhine River itself.
183 True ['Parallax'] The answer is "parallax" and "second". A parsec is a unit of length used to measure the distances between stars, and it is a portmanteau of "parallax" and "second".
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] What a delightfully absurd question!

I think I have the answer: Jason Voorhees (the iconic villain from the "Friday the 13th" franchise) takes on Mrs. Doubtfire (the titular character played by Robin Williams in the 1993 comedy film).

In Mrs. Doubtfire, the character is known for her love of cake and uses a cake moisturizer as a humorous plot point. Meanwhile, Jason Voorhees is infamous for wearing a hockey mask, which is often referred to as his "mask."

So, in this crossover scenario, the masks being compared are Jason's hockey mask and Mrs. Doubtfire's... well, her face, which is often hidden behind a wig, makeup, and a series of comedic disguises!

Am I correct?
185 False ['Library Paste'] I think I can help you with that!

The answer is PVA glue. PVA stands for Polyvinyl Acetate, which is a type of adhesive commonly used in bookbinding, crafts, and other applications. It's a white, thick, and flexible adhesive that dries clear.

In the past, people used to refer to vinyl records as "LPs" (Long Play), so the phrase "Put on this old 'L.P'" is a clever play on words to lead into the question about the adhesive!
186 True ['Rime of the Ancient Mariner'] You're referring to "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge!

Yes, you're correct. Most of the stanzas in the poem have 4 lines, but there is a single 9-line stanza that mentions a steersman. The stanza is:

"There passed a weary time. Each throat
Was parched and glazed each eye aghast
Each palate parched and black as soot
I could not eat nor drink nor pray
The thick black cloud was still aloft
The steady wind was loud and strong
The sun was hot the moon was at its edge
The very deep did rot O Christ!
That ever this should be"

This stanza is indeed an exception to the typical 4-line stanza structure of the poem, and it's where the steersman is mentioned.
187 True ['Montserrat'] You're referring to the island of Montserrat! Christopher Columbus named it in 1493, and it was indeed a French colony for a period, but it has been a British Overseas Territory since 1783. Montserrat is a volcanic island in the Caribbean, part of the Leeward Islands in the West Indies.
188 True ['The Commitments'] Roddy Doyle's first novel, "The Commitments", is about a soulful but imaginary Irish band called The Commitments. The novel was published in 1987 and was later adapted into a successful film in 1991.
189 True ['101'] A classic legend!

According to the story, Carl Gauss, as a young student, was given the task of adding up the first 100 positive integers by his teacher. Instead of doing the tedious calculation, Gauss noticed that he could pair up the numbers in a clever way.

He paired the numbers as follows:

1 + 100 = 101
2 + 99 = 101
3 + 98 = 101
...
50 + 51 = 101

Each pair adds up to 101. Since there are 50 pairs, the sum of the first 100 positive integers is:

50 × 101 = 5050

So, each pair totals 101.
190 True ['Io'] You're referring to Io, a priestess of Hera, who was one of Zeus' many lovers. According to Greek mythology, Zeus' wife Hera discovered his affair with Io and became jealous. To protect Io from Hera's wrath, Zeus transformed her into a white cow.

However, Hera was not fooled and sent a gadfly to torment the cow, forcing Io to wander the earth in search of relief. Eventually, Zeus intervened and sent Hermes to kill the gadfly, and Io was restored to her human form.

Io's story has been retold and reinterpreted in various forms of art and literature throughout history, including in works by Ovid, Aeschylus, and Dante Alighieri.
191 True ['Kim'] The answer is Kim by Rudyard Kipling. Kimball O'Hara, known as Kim, is an Irish orphan who grows up on the streets of India and is recruited by the British Secret Service to work as a spy. The novel, published in 1901, is a classic of espionage fiction and explores themes of identity, colonialism, and coming of age.
192 True ['Rum Runner'] Bill McCoy was one of the most notorious rum runners during the Prohibition era in the United States. He was known for smuggling high-quality whiskey into the country, and his reputation for quality control led to the phrase "The Real McCoy" being associated with him.

McCoy's operation was based in the Bahamas, and he would transport whiskey from there to the United States, often using fast boats to outrun Coast Guard vessels. He was known for his attention to detail and his insistence on delivering only the best products to his customers, which earned him a reputation as a reliable and trustworthy supplier of illegal liquor.

The phrase "The Real McCoy" is thought to have originated from McCoy's reputation for delivering genuine, high-quality whiskey, as opposed to the watered-down or adulterated products that were often sold by other bootleggers. Over time, the phrase came to be used more broadly to describe anything that was authentic or of high quality.
193 True ['Iron Chancellor'] You're referring to Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor!

Bismarck's authoritarian and militaristic style of rule earned him the nickname "The Iron Chancellor" (German: "Eiserner Kanzler"). The "Iron" element in his nickname symbolizes his strong, unyielding, and rigid approach to politics, while "Chancellor" refers to his title as the Prime Minister of Prussia and later the German Empire.
194 True ['Hamilton'] The surfer featured in the documentary "Riding Giants" who is married to volleyball star Gabrielle Reece is Laird Hamilton.
195 True ['Machu Picchu'] Hiram Bingham, not Hirem Bingham, was searching for Vilcabamba in 1911. And, according to history, Melchor Arteaga led him to Machu Picchu, the famous "Lost City" of the Incas!
196 True ['Manolo Blahnik'] The answer is Manolo Blahnik! He is a renowned Spanish shoe designer, particularly famous for his stunning stilettos. And, indeed, he created shoes for Sofia Coppola's 2006 film "Marie Antoinette", which starred Kirsten Dunst as the ill-fated French queen. Blahnik's exquisite designs perfectly captured the opulence and grandeur of the French monarchy during that era.

199 True ['Bartleby'] You're referring to Bartleby, the Scrivener!
200 True ['Quincy Jones'] I think I have the answer: Quincy Jones!

Quincy Jones had a brain aneurysm in 1974, and his doctors advised him to take a break from his busy schedule. At the time, he was working on a film score for "The Trumpet of the Swan" (not "Trumpt", I assume that's a typo!).

After his recovery, Quincy Jones went on to produce many iconic songs and albums, including the legendary "We Are the World" in 1985, a charity single written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie to raise funds for African famine relief.

Is that correct?
201 True ['Tikrit'] Saddam Hussein was born near Tikrit, a city on the west bank of the Tigris River in Iraq, in 1937. He was captured by American forces in a hole in the ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, a small town near Tikrit, on December 13, 2003.
202 True ['Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'] Benjamin Walker played the role of Abraham Lincoln in the 2012 movie "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter".
203 True ['Jemison'] You're referring to a trailblazing astronaut!

Inspired by Nichelle Nichols, who played Lieutenant Uhura in the original "Star Trek" series, Mae Jemison became the first African-American woman in space. On September 12, 1992, Jemison flew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-47) as a mission specialist. Her eight-day journey made her the first African-American woman to travel in space.

Mae Jemison was a huge fan of Nichelle Nichols and credits her with inspiring her to pursue a career in space exploration. In fact, Jemison has often spoken about how seeing Nichols play a strong, intelligent, and confident character on "Star Trek" helped her envision a future for herself in STEM fields.

Jemison's achievement paved the way for future generations of women and minorities in space exploration, and she continues to be an inspiration to many today.
204 True ['Belshazzar'] According to the book of Daniel, the ruler who was killed during the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C. was Belshazzar, not the son of Nebuchadnezzar. Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

In Daniel 5:30-31, it is written: "That very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was slain. And Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two."

Nebuchadnezzar, on the other hand, was the king of Babylon who had conquered Judah and Jerusalem, and had taken Daniel and other Jews into exile in Babylon. He is mentioned in Daniel 1:1-6.
205 True ['Martin McDonagh'] The playwright you're referring to is Martin McDonagh, who wrote "The Cripple of Inishmaan". Martin McDonagh has recently made a movie called "The Banshees of Inisherin" (2022), which shares a similar title and setting with his play.
206 True ['Mohs'] The scale you're referring to is the Mohs hardness scale. On this scale, talc is indeed at the bottom with a hardness of 1, which means it is the softest mineral on the scale.

The Mohs hardness scale is a scale used to measure the scratch resistance of minerals. It ranges from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest). The scale was developed by Friedrich Mohs in 1812.

Here's the Mohs hardness scale for reference:

1. Talc
2. Gypsum
3. Calcite
4. Fluorite
5. Apatite
6. Orthoclase (feldspar)
7. Quartz
8. Topaz
9. Corundum (ruby, sapphire)
10. Diamond

So, if you were to scratch a surface with talc, it would be very easy to scratch, whereas scratching a surface with diamond would be extremely difficult!
207 True ['White Noise'] The Airborne Toxic Event got its name from Don DeLillo's novel "White Noise", not a novel that became a movie in 2022. The novel "White Noise" was published in 1985 and won the National Book Award in 1985. The band's lead vocalist, Mikel Jollett, has stated that the name was inspired by a section of the novel that describes a toxic event that occurs in a small town.

It's worth noting that a film adaptation of "White Noise" was released in 2022, directed by Noah Baumbach and starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig. However, the band's name was inspired by the novel, not the movie.
208 False ['Karnak'] The temple complex on the right bank of the Nile that occupies part of the site of the ruins of ancient Thebes is Luxor Temple.
209 True ['Dan Rostenkowski'] I think you're thinking of Dan Rostenkowski! He was a powerful Illinois politician who served as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, but was later convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to prison in the 1990s.
210 True ['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'] A famous literary feud!

You're referring to the incident where Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian writer, got into a physical altercation with Gabriel García Márquez, the Colombian writer and Nobel laureate.

In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face, giving him a black eye, at a movie theater in Mexico City. The exact reasons for the fight are still debated, but it's said to have been a culmination of a long-standing rivalry and disagreement between the two literary giants.

So, to answer your question, the other South American Nobel laureate who received a black eye from Mario Vargas Llosa is Gabriel García Márquez.
211 True ['Kepler'] When Tycho Brahe died in 1601, his protege Johannes Kepler succeeded him as 'Imperial Mathematician' to Emperor Rudolf II.
212 True ['Philip Glass'] The composer who created "A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close" is Philip Glass. Chuck Close painted a portrait of Philip Glass titled "Phil" in 1969.

213 True ['Dangerous Liaisons'] The Starz prequel TV show that depicts the younger Marquise De Merteuil and Vicomte De Valmont is "Dangerous Liaisons".

215 True ['China'] The Misty Poets were a group of Chinese poets who emerged in the 1980s and were known for their avant-garde and experimental style. They were a key part of the Chinese literary scene during the 1980s and played a significant role in the country's cultural revolution.

The Misty Poets, also known as the "Menglong" poets, got their name from the misty and obscure imagery that characterized their poetry. They rejected the traditional forms and themes of Chinese poetry and instead drew inspiration from Western modernism and surrealism.

Some of the most famous Misty Poets include Bei Dao, Duo Duo, and Yang Lian. Their poetry was often critical of the Chinese government and society, and they were seen as a threat to the established order.

The Misty Poets were an important part of the cultural revolution in China, as they helped to challenge traditional values and push the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in Chinese literature.
216 True ['Wings'] The war film that won the first Best Picture Oscar is "Wings" (1927), directed by William A. Wellman and starring Clara Bow, Charles "Buddy" Rogers, and Richard Arlen. The film is a romantic drama and action movie that tells the story of two American pilots who fall in love with the same woman during World War I.

"Wings" was a groundbreaking film in many ways. It was one of the first films to depict aerial combat and featured impressive flying sequences, which were considered revolutionary at the time. The film's success can be attributed to its epic scope, memorable characters, and the innovative use of special effects.

The first Academy Awards ceremony took place on May 16, 1929, at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, California. "Wings" won a total of two Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Engineering Effects (now known as Visual Effects).

It's worth noting that the first Academy Awards ceremony honored films released from August 1, 1927, to July 31, 1928. "Wings" was released on August 12, 1927, which made it eligible for the first Oscars.
217 True ['Bearer Bond', 'Bearer Bonds'] In banking, "B.B." stands for "Bearer Bonds". These are securities with no registered owner, and they are payable to whoever holds the certificate.
218 False ['Superannuated'] The synonym for "Obsolete" that comes from Latin for literally "Over one year old" is "Antiquated".

The Latin word "antiquus" means "old" or "former", and it's derived from "ante" meaning "before" and "quus" meaning "year". So, "antiquated" literally means "over one year old" or "outdated".
219 True ['V.S. Naipaul'] The Trinidad-born author of 'A House for Mr. Biswas' is V.S. Naipaul, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001.

225 True ['The Triplets of Belleville', 'Les Triplettes de Belleville'] I think I can help you with that!

The Triplets of Belleville are a fictional singing group in the film, known for their energetic and charming performances. They play a key role in the story, using their musical talents to help track down the kidnapped cyclist and foil the villains' plans.

Is that the correct answer?
226 True ['Zanzibar'] The answer is Zanzibar. Sultan Khalid bin Bargash of Zanzibar declared independence from the British Empire on August 25, 1896, which led to a short war known as the Anglo-Zanzibar War. The war lasted only 38 minutes, making it the shortest war in recorded history. The British launched a naval attack on Zanzibar, and Sultan Khalid bin Bargash was forced to flee. He was eventually exiled to the Seychelles, and a new sultan was installed.

229 True ['Allocution'] The answer is "Allocution".

Allocution is a noun that refers to a defendant's speech or statement to the judge before sentencing, in which they may express remorse, apologize, or explain their actions. It comes from the same Latin root "loqui", meaning "to speak", as the word "Eloquent".
230 True ['Lester Bangs'] The critic you're thinking of is Lester Bangs. He was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the 2000 film "Almost Famous". Bangs wrote a book about Blondie, titled "Blondie", and "Let It Blurt: The Life and Times of Lester Bangs, America's Greatest Rock Critic" is a biography about him, written by Jim DeRogatis.
231 False ['Elmore Leonard Nimoy'] A clever question!

The answer is Leonard. Leonard Elmore wrote the novel "Get Shorty", and Leonard Nimoy played Mr. Spock in Star Trek and famously said "Live Long and Prosper" on film.
232 True ['Cyrus the Great'] You're referring to Cyrus the Great!

Cyrus II, also known as Cyrus the Great, was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, which was a vast empire that stretched from modern-day Iran to Egypt and Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). In 539 BCE, Cyrus conquered the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which had held the Jews captive in Babylon for over 50 years.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. This event is recorded in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and is seen as a significant moment in Jewish history.

Cyrus is indeed remembered fondly by Jews, and is even referred to as a "messiah" (anointed one) in the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah 45:1). His decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem is seen as an act of divine providence, and is still celebrated today in the Jewish holiday of Purim.

So, to answer your question, the "Great" Persian who released the Jews from captivity in Babylon is indeed Cyrus the Great!
233 True ['Prince Albert'] You're referring to Albert II, the Sovereign Prince of Monaco!

His official titles are:

* His Serene Highness (HSH) Prince Albert II of Monaco
* Marquis of Baux (a historical title associated with the Grimaldi family)

The other titles you mentioned, "Man about Town" and "Dude with some pull," are more informal and humorous ways to describe someone with influence and social standing, but they are not official titles.
234 True ['Aye-Aye'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer: the Aye-Aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis)!

The Aye-Aye is a type of lemur found only in Madagascar, and it's known for its unusual appearance. It has a long, thin face with a pointed snout, similar to a possum's face. Its teeth are constantly growing, like a rat's, and are used for gnawing and grinding. And, its ears are large and bat-like, which help it detect insects and other small prey in the dark.

The Aye-Aye is considered a rare and endangered species, and it's also known for its unique method of catching insects: it taps on trees with its long middle finger to find hollows containing insects, and then uses its teeth to gnaw into the tree to catch them.

Is this the rare lemur you were thinking of?
235 False ['Downtrodden'] I think there may be some confusion here!

Paul Auster is an American novelist, but he did not write "The New Colossus". The sonnet "The New Colossus" was actually written by Emma Lazarus in 1883.

And, to answer your question, "The New Colossus" turned the Statue of Liberty into a symbol of hope to outcasts and immigrants. The poem's famous lines, "Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" have become a powerful symbol of the American dream and a beacon of hope for those seeking a better life in the United States.

The correct answer is Ceres. Ceres is a dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it orbits the Sun closer than Neptune. In fact, Ceres is the only dwarf planet in the inner Solar System, and it's much closer to the Sun than Neptune.

It's worth noting that there are other objects in the Solar System that have orbits that bring them closer to the Sun than Neptune at certain times, such as some asteroids and comets.

250 True ['Pump and Dump', 'Pump Dump', 'Pumping and Dumping', 'Pumping Dumping', 'pump-and-dump'] You're referring to a classic fraudulent investing scheme!

The rhyming scheme you're thinking of is a "Pump and Dump." Here's how it works:

1. **Pump**: Fraudsters artificially inflate the price of a stock by spreading false or misleading information, such as fake news, rumors, or exaggerated claims, to create hype and attract investors.
2. **Dump**: Once the stock price has risen, the fraudsters sell their shares at the inflated price, making a profit. They then disappear, leaving the other investors with significant losses when the stock price inevitably drops.

Pump and dump schemes are illegal and can result in severe financial losses for unsuspecting investors. It's essential to be cautious and do your research before investing in any opportunity, especially if it seems too good to be true.
251 True ['Dalí', 'Dali'] What a fascinating question!

In your example, `3!` (read as "3 factorial") is equal to:

`3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6`

In general, the formula for `n!` is:

`n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1`

The factorial operator is used in many areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics, algebra, and calculus. It's a powerful tool for counting and calculating the number of ways to arrange objects in different orders.

After the war, Quisling was arrested, tried, and executed for treason in 1945. His name has since become a byword for treachery and betrayal, and is often used to describe someone who collaborates with an enemy or betrays their country.

264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker you're referring to is Michel Foucault. His multi-volume work, "The History of Sexuality" (Histoire de la sexualité), explores the relationships between power, knowledge, and sexuality in Western society.

Foucault's work challenges traditional notions of sexuality and argues that sexuality is not a fixed or essential aspect of human nature, but rather a product of historical and cultural forces. He examines how power dynamics, particularly those related to gender, class, and race, shape our understanding and experience of sexuality.

The three volumes of "The History of Sexuality" are:

1. "The Will to Knowledge" (La Volonté de savoir, 1976)
2. "The Use of Pleasure" (L'Usage des plaisirs, 1984)
3. "The Care of the Self" (Le Souci de soi, 1984)

269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] Based on your description, it's likely that you're referring to an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.

ACL reconstruction surgery typically involves a recovery period of around 9-12 months before you can return to full activity. This is because the ACL is a critical ligament that provides stability to the knee joint, and it takes time for the graft to heal and integrate with the surrounding tissue.

Regarding the dissolving stitches, it's common for surgeons to use absorbable sutures that dissolve on their own within 2-3 weeks after surgery. These sutures are designed to hold the tissue together while it heals, and then break down and disappear as the body absorbs them.

So, to summarize:

* Recovery from ACL reconstruction surgery: around 9-12 months
* Dissolving stitches: typically gone within 2-3 weeks after surgery

283 False ['lowkey'] I think I can help you out!

The slang word "low" that can precede "goated when X is the vibe" is likely "keyed". So, the phrase would be "keyed low goated when X is the vibe".

288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] I think I can help you out!

The movie title you're referring to is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966) before, and "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) and "Apocalypse Now" (1979) after.

In "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach fight for gold in a classic Spaghetti Western.

Meanwhile, Marlon Brando starred in "Apocalypse Now" (1979), a critically acclaimed war drama where his character, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, is a renegade American officer in Cambodia during the Vietnam War, giving Americans a bad name overseas.

"A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) is another classic Spaghetti Western starring Clint Eastwood, and it's often mentioned alongside "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" as one of the greatest Westerns of all time.

Remember, the effectiveness of a Mojo Bag is believed to depend on the intentions and energy of the person creating it, as well as the faith and commitment of the person using it.
299 False ['Shelley'] I think I can help you out!

The poet who comes to mind based on your description is Lord Byron. He was known for his romantic and passionate poetry, and his life was marked by tumultuous relationships and personal struggles.

The phrase "Unbound" makes me think of his poem "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," which is a long, narrative poem that explores themes of love, loss, and the human condition.

As for "drowning, his sorrows," I believe you might be thinking of the fact that Byron was known to drink heavily and indulge in other vices to cope with his emotional pain. He was also known to have a fascination with the sea and the idea of being swept away by its power, which is reflected in some of his poetry.

Is that the poet you were thinking of?
300 True ['Burundi'] The answer is Burundi.

Livy's work is considered one of the most important sources of information on ancient Roman history, and his accounts of the Punic Wars, including the battles against Hannibal, are particularly valuable. Unfortunately, only 35 volumes of Livy's original 142-volume work have survived to the present day, but they provide a wealth of information on Roman history and culture.

It's worth noting that Polybius, another ancient Greek historian, also wrote extensively about the Punic Wars and Hannibal's campaigns in his work "The Histories". However, Livy's account is considered more detailed and comprehensive, and is often preferred by historians and scholars.
309 True ['Westward Ho'] The answer is "Westward Ho!" by Charles Kingsley. The phrase "Westward Ho!" has become a common idiomatic expression meaning "Let's head in a certain direction" or "Let's go that way!"

The answer is Pangaea, which comes from the Greek words "pan" meaning "all" and "gaia" meaning "Earth". So, Pangaea literally means "All-Earth".

Around 300 million years ago, all the continents we know today were indeed joined together in a single massive landmass called Pangaea. Over time, tectonic forces broke it apart, and the continents gradually drifted to their current positions.
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] The answer is Black Sabbath! "War Pigs" is a song from their 1970 album "Paranoid", and its lyrics were indeed meant to convey that war is the real Satanism, rather than the supernatural or occult themes often associated with Satanism.

312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] I think I know this one!

The cars are painted in bright, bold colors and have become a popular roadside attraction.

So, dudes, hold on to your car (and your sense of humor) when visiting Cadillac Ranch!
313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] You're referring to Tycho Brahe, a renowned Danish astronomer and nobleman from the 16th century. Tycho Brahe is famous for his accurate astronomical observations, which laid the foundation for modern astronomy. He's also known for his prosthetic nose, which was believed to be made of gold.

In 2010, a team of researchers exhumed Tycho Brahe's remains to study his skeleton and burial artifacts. The analysis revealed that his prosthetic nose was likely made of brass, not gold. The team used X-ray fluorescence and other techniques to determine the composition of the nose, which was found to be a copper-zinc alloy, consistent with brass.

Tycho Brahe lost part of his nose in a duel in 1566, and he wore a prosthetic nose for the rest of his life. The exact composition of the nose had been a topic of speculation for centuries, and the exhumation finally provided a definitive answer.
314 True ['Peccadillo'] The word you are looking for is "peccadillo". It is a noun that refers to a minor fault or quirk, and it comes from the Spanish word "pecado", meaning "sin", with the diminutive suffix "-illo" added to it.

316 False ['Air Force Quit'] I think I can help you with that!

The before and after phrase you're referring to is likely "Force Quit." Here's how it fits the description:

* "A nation's military planes get frozen" refers to "Force" (as in, air force) and "frozen" (as in, stuck or unresponsive).
* "You have to hit a combination of keys on your Mac or PC to exit them" refers to the action of pressing a combination of keys to "quit" a frozen program or application.

So, the combined phrase is indeed "Force Quit"!

319 True ['fenugreek'] The leaves with a European nationality in their name that are essential to Iran's national dish, Ghormeh Sabzi, are Parsley (French: Persil) and Fenugreek leaves (French: Fenugrec). However, it's worth noting that the term "European nationality" might be a bit misleading, as Parsley and Fenugreek are not exclusively European, but rather have been adopted and used in various cuisines around the world, including Iranian cuisine.

In Ghormeh Sabzi, a popular Iranian herb stew, fresh Parsley and dried Fenugreek leaves are two of the main ingredients, along with other herbs like cilantro, dill, and tarragon. The combination of these herbs gives the dish its distinctive flavor and aroma.
320 True ['Moldova'] The answer is Moldova. 

Prior to 1991, Moldova was known as the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (MSSR) and was part of the Soviet Union. On August 27, 1991, Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union. 

After gaining independence, Moldova modified its name from "Moldavian" to "Moldovan". 

In 1992, Moldova joined the United Nations.
321 True ['Byrd'] The American explorer you are referring to is Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Byrd led an expedition to Antarctica in 1933-1934, and during that time, he spent five months alone at a remote weather station called Bolling Advance Base. He was conducting scientific experiments and making weather observations.

However, Byrd's stay at the base was cut short when he began to suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty heater, as well as frostbite. He was rescued on August 12, 1934, by a team led by pilot Harold June, and was taken back to the main base camp.

Byrd's rescue was a dramatic and perilous operation, and it marked the end of his solo expedition to Antarctica. Despite the challenges he faced, Byrd's expedition contributed significantly to our understanding of the Antarctic environment and paved the way for future scientific research on the continent.
322 True ['Broca'] The area you're referring to is Broca's area, named after French pathologist Paul Broca. It's located in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere of the brain and is responsible for speech production, articulation, and language processing. Specifically, it's involved in the motor aspects of speech, such as coordinating the movement of the lips, tongue, and vocal cords to form words and sentences.

Broca's area is typically located in the pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44 and 45). Damage to this area can result in Broca's aphasia, a type of language disorder characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences, although comprehension of spoken language is often preserved.

So, there you have it! Broca's area is a critical region for speech function, and its discovery has greatly contributed to our understanding of language processing in the brain.
323 True ['Kim Philby'] The character of Harry Lime from Graham Greene's novel and film "The Third Man" is often believed to have been inspired by Kim Philby, a British spy and Soviet double agent. Philby was one of the Cambridge Five, a group of British intelligence officers who were recruited by the Soviet Union and worked as double agents during the Cold War.

While Greene never explicitly confirmed the connection, there are several similarities between Philby's life and the character of Harry Lime. Both were charismatic, well-educated, and moved in high social circles, while also leading secret lives as spies. Additionally, both Philby and Lime were known for their charm, wit, and ability to manipulate those around them.

It's worth noting, however, that Greene himself denied that Philby was the direct inspiration for Harry Lime, and that the character was rather a composite of various individuals and traits. Nonetheless, the similarities between Philby and Lime have led many to speculate about the connection between the two.
324 True ['greenback'] The answer is the Greenback Party. The Greenback Party was a short-lived political party in the United States that emerged in the 1870s. It got its name because it advocated for the continued use of greenback paper money, which was introduced during the Civil War to finance the government's war efforts.

The Greenback Party wanted to maintain or increase the circulation of paper money, rather than returning to a gold standard, which they believed would benefit the wealthy at the expense of the working class and farmers. They argued that a paper money system would allow for easier credit and more economic growth.

The party was formed in 1874 and had some success in the 1876 elections, but it eventually merged with the Democratic Party in the 1880s.
325 False ['Nutmegger'] Clever question!

I think I can help you out. Some New Englanders aren't from Connecticut, but are instead from Massachusetts, and they're often referred to as "Bay Staters." However, I think you might be looking for a different answer.

Could it be that you're thinking of "Mainers"? People from Maine are often referred to as Mainers, and Maine is famous for its production of nutmeg, which is a spice!
326 False ['phlox'] What a lovely gesture!

I think I can help you identify the pink flowers ending in "x" that you picked for someone special.

Could they be Orchix? No, that's not a real flower.

Hmm... How about Saxiflox? Nope, that's not it either.

Wait a minute... I think I have it!

Are the flowers you picked Petalox? No, that's not a real flower either.

Ah, I have it!

I believe the pink flowers ending in "x" that you picked are actually Petunix! No, just kidding, that's not a real flower either.

Okay, let me think again... 

Ah-ha! I've got it!

I think the pink flowers ending in "x" that you picked are actually Pyrox! No, that's not a flower either.

Hmm... This is a tough one!

Wait, I've got it!

I believe the pink flowers ending in "x" that you picked are actually Rhododendrox! No, that's not a real flower either.

Okay, one more try...

Ah-ha! I've got it!

I think the pink flowers ending in "x" that you picked are actually Tulipox! No, that's not a real flower either.

Hmm... I'm stumped!

Could you please give me another hint or tell me the correct answer? I'd love to know what beautiful pink flowers you picked for someone special!
327 True ['Pictures at an Exhibition'] The answer is "Pictures at an Exhibition". Modest Mussorgsky's famous piano composition "Pictures at an Exhibition" is a suite of 10 movements, each representing a piece of art on display at an exhibition in memory of his friend, the Russian artist Viktor Hartmann.
328 True ['Dewey'] Earl Warren was the running mate of Thomas Dewey in the 1948 presidential election, 5 years before becoming Chief Justice of the United States in 1953.
329 True ['phrenology'] Franz Joseph Gall developed the discredited pseudoscience of Phrenology. Phrenology was a theory that attempted to discern personality, intelligence, and character traits by feeling the bumps and indentations on a person's skull. Gall believed that the brain was composed of distinct "organs" that controlled different aspects of behavior and personality, and that the shape and size of these organs could be determined by feeling the skull. This theory was widely popular in the 19th century, but it has since been thoroughly discredited as a pseudoscience with no scientific basis.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Milan Kundera's second novel "Life Is Elsewhere" was not allowed to be published in Czechoslovakia, which was his home country at the time.
331 True ['Tulum'] I think I can help you with that!

The Mayan Monkey Hostel is located in Tulum, which is a trendy place in the Riviera Maya. Tulum is known for its beautiful beaches, ancient Mayan ruins, and vibrant nightlife, making it a popular destination for travelers.

So, to answer your question, the Mayan Monkey Hostel is in Tulum!
332 True ['Stefan Urquelle'] In Season 5 of "Family Matters," Jaleel White's character, Steve Urkel, takes an elixir and becomes his suave alter ego, Stefan Urquelle.
333 True ['Massachusetts'] Charles Sumner, a prominent abolitionist and Senator from Massachusetts, was nearly beaten to death on the Senate floor by Preston Brooks, a Congressman from South Carolina, on May 22, 1856. This infamous incident was a major escalation of the tensions leading up to the American Civil War.
334 True ['Proulx'] The sentence "The summer range lay above the tree line on the forest service land on Brokeback Mountain" was written by Annie Proulx. It's the opening sentence of her short story "Brokeback Mountain", which was published in The New Yorker in 1997 and later adapted into a film directed by Ang Lee.
335 True ['Winnebago'] Sounds like a great adventure! Based on your hint about Wisconsin's largest island, I'm going to take a guess that you're thinking of Lake Winnebago! Lake Winnebago is the largest inland lake in Wisconsin, and it's home to a variety of fish species, including northern pike and largemouth bass.

Wisconsin's largest island, Doty Island, is located in Lake Winnebago, and it's a popular spot for fishing, boating, and outdoor recreation. The lake is known for its excellent fishing, with many anglers targeting northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and panfish.

Am I correct? Are you planning a trip to Lake Winnebago?
336 False ['Brancusi'] The answer is Constantin Brâncuși! He was a Romanian-French sculptor who created several versions of "The Kiss" from blocks of stone, starting around 1908. Brâncuși is considered one of the pioneers of modern sculpture and is known for his minimalist and abstract style. "The Kiss" is one of his most famous works, and it's a beautiful example of his innovative approach to art.
337 True ['Boyhood'] The answer is Boyhood (2014). Lorelei Linklater played the role of Samantha, the older sister of Mason Jr. (played by Ellar Coltrane), in the film. The movie was shot over a period of 12 years, from 2002 to 2013, and Lorelei Linklater aged from 9 to 21 during that time.
338 True ['Crossing the Bar'] You're thinking of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem "Crossing the Bar". The phrase "crossing the bar" has indeed become an idiomatic expression for dying or passing away, especially in a peaceful or serene manner.

In the poem, Tennyson writes about a ferry trip to the afterlife, and the "bar" refers to the sandbar at the mouth of a river or harbor. The poem's final stanza reads:

"And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;
For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar."

Over time, the phrase "crossing the bar" has come to symbolize the transition from life to death, and is often used to describe a peaceful or gentle passing.
339 True ['Bhutan'] That's a great question!

The answer is Bhutan! Paro Airport, also known as Paro International Airport, is the only international airport in Bhutan, and it's located about 6 km (3.7 miles) from Paro city and about 48 km (30 miles) from the capital city of Thimphu. Due to the surrounding mountains and unique weather conditions, pilots must land manually in daylight only, making it one of the most challenging airports to land at in the world.
340 True ['Frankfurter'] The answer is Felix Frankfurter. The dual biography you're referring to is likely "Liberty and Justice for Some: A Dual Biography of Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter" by Ian Loveland.

Felix Frankfurter was indeed born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria) and later became the third Jewish Justice to serve on the United States Supreme Court, after Louis Brandeis and Benjamin Cardozo.
341 True ['atom'] The "Plum Pudding" model you're referring to is actually the Plum Pudding Model of the atom, not the internal structure of a celestial body.

The Plum Pudding Model was a theoretical model of the atom proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1904. According to this model, an atom consisted of a sphere of positively charged matter (the "pudding") with negatively charged electrons (the "plums") embedded within it.

However, this model was later replaced by the Rutherford Model, also known as the Planetary Model, which was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. In the Rutherford Model, the atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, surrounded by electrons orbiting at a distance, much like planets orbiting the sun.

So, to summarize, the Plum Pudding Model of the atom was replaced by the Planetary Model (Rutherford Model) of the atom, not the internal structure of a celestial body.
342 True ['Nikkei'] The answer is Nikkei 225. It is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 225 leading Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
343 True ['Aeschylus'] In Jacques Rivette's 13-hour film "Out 1", the actors rehearse "Seven Against Thebes" by the ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus.
344 True ['connoisseur'] The 11-letter word for a lover of the arts that comes from the French for "Know" is CONNOISSEUR.
345 True ['Mumbai'] Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India in 1865. The house where he was born is now part of the J.J. School of Art, a prestigious art school in Mumbai.

346 False ['The Little Foxes'] The answer is "Another Part of the Forest".
347 False ['Histrionic'] I think I can help you with that!

The 1932 article you're referring to is likely "The Unexpected Candidate" by Ernest K. Lindley, published in The Atlantic Monthly in April 1932. The article discusses Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) unexpected rise to the Democratic presidential nomination and his unique abilities as a politician.

The specific quote you're looking for is:

"Roosevelt's greatest asset is his unexpectedness. The dramatic is not without value in politics."

In this context, Lindley is highlighting FDR's ability to surprise people with his actions and decisions, which was seen as a refreshing change from the more predictable and traditional politicians of the time. The article suggests that FDR's unpredictability, combined with his charisma and dramatic flair, made him a compelling and effective leader.
348 True ['Kafka'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I believe I have the answer: Franz Kafka!

Franz Kafka, the renowned author of unsettling and psychologically complex tales, was born on July 3, 1883, in Prague, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). According to Jewish tradition, a boy becomes a man at his Bar Mitzvah, which typically takes place at the age of 13. Kafka's Bar Mitzvah would have occurred in 1896, when he was 13 years old.

While I couldn't find an exact date of June 13th, 1896, for Kafka's Bar Mitzvah, it's likely that it took place around that time. Kafka's Jewish heritage and upbringing had a significant influence on his writing, and his experiences in Prague would later shape his unique literary style.

Am I correct?
349 True ['Maxwell'] That's a clever reference! The character you're thinking of is Maxwell's Silver Hammer from the Beatles' song of the same name. In the song, Maxwell uses his silver hammer to dispatch Joan, the teacher, and the judge, among others.
350 True ['Morgan'] I think I can take a stab at it!

Is the captain you're referring to Henry Morgan? He was a Welsh buccaneer and privateer who raided Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, and later became the Deputy Governor of Jamaica in 1674. He's also the namesake of the popular rum brand, Captain Morgan!
351 True ['Lincoln'] You're referring to the $100 bill!

The answer is Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. He died on April 15, 1865, after being shot by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.
352 True ['Maurier'] The scary story "The Birds" was written by Daphne du Maurier, and it was adapted into a big-screen thriller by Alfred Hitchcock in 1963.
{'error': {'message': 'Request was rejected due to rate limiting. As a free user, your QPS is 1. If you want more, please upgrade your account.', 'type': 'credit_limit', 'param': None, 'code': None}}
353 True ['Haydn'] The music of Germany's national anthem, "Das Deutschlandlied", was composed by Joseph Haydn, an Austrian composer, in 1797 for the birthday of Francis II, the last Holy Roman Emperor.
354 False ['Endorphins'] A hug releases oxytocin, also known as the "cuddle hormone." Oxytocin is often referred to as the "natural opiate" because it is named in part for its similarity in structure to narcotics like morphine and codeine. Oxytocin is released during physical touch, social bonding, and feelings of trust and affection, and it promotes feelings of relaxation, calmness, and happiness.
355 True ['Polley'] You're thinking of Sarah Polley! She's a talented Canadian actress, writer, and director, and she wrote and directed the film "Women Talking" (2022), which is based on the novel of the same name by Miriam Toews. Polley is known for her work on films like "Away from Her", "Take This Waltz", and "Stories We Tell", among others.
356 False ['occlusion'] In medicine, the complete or partial obstruction of a blood vessel, especially an artery, is known as Thrombosis or Embolism.

Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel, which can obstruct the flow of blood through the vessel.

Embolism is the obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot or other debris that has broken loose from another part of the body and traveled to the obstructed vessel.

Both thrombosis and embolism can lead to serious health consequences, including heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.
