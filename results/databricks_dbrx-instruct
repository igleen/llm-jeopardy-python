0 True ['Bogart'] The answer is "Bogart." This last name belongs to the iconic Hollywood actor, Humphrey Bogart, known for his roles in classic films like "Casablanca" and "The Maltese Falcon."

It's believed to have originated from Bogart's on-screen persona, which sometimes involved him smoking in a distinctive, intense manner.
1 True ['Fiji'] 70% of Fiji's population lives on its largest island, Viti Levu. Fiji is a country in the South Pacific Ocean that is made up of more than 300 islands.

It is a popular tourist destination, and many visitors come to Viti Levu to experience its natural beauty and learn about its rich history and culture.
2 True ['Calder'] The idea that art must be static is a traditional notion that has been challenged by many artists throughout history. Sculpture, in particular, has often been associated with static forms, but there is no inherent reason why it must be so. In fact, the incorporation of motion into sculpture can add a new dimension to the work, allowing for a more dynamic and engaging experience for the viewer.

Alexander Calder, a renowned American sculptor, is often credited with pioneering the concept of mobile sculpture, which incorporates movement and balance to create a constantly changing work of art. Calder's mobiles are designed to move gently with air currents, creating a sense of fluidity and grace that is not possible with static sculpture.

The idea of incorporating motion into sculpture is not limited to mobiles, however. Other artists have explored the use of mechanical elements, digital technology, and even performance to create sculptures that are in a state of constant transformation. These works challenge the viewer to engage with the art in a more active way, as they must constantly adjust their perspective to take in the changing forms.

In short, the notion that art must be static is a limiting one, and the incorporation of motion into sculpture can open up new possibilities for artistic expression. As Alexander Calder himself once said, "To an engineer, good enough means perfect. With an artist, there's no such thing as perfect." By embracing the potential for motion in sculpture, artists can push the boundaries of what is possible and create works that are truly unique and engaging.
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] Harry Potter, in the realm of fantasy and magic, might have a better chance of turning metals to gold using the medieval substance from alchemy known as the Philosopher's Stone, also referred to as the "tincture."

19 True ['Ethiopia'] ¡Gracias por tu pregunta! Hubert Julian, also known as the "Black Eagle," was indeed a pioneering Black aviator and adventurer. However, he did not fight for an African empire against Italy in the 1930s. Instead, he gained fame for his daring stunts and skydiving feats.

The African empire you might be referring to is Ethiopia, which was invaded by Italy in 1935. A notable African American who fought for Ethiopia during that time was John C. Robinson, known as the "Brown Condor." He served as a pilot and helped train the Ethiopian Air Force.

So, while Hubert Julian was a fascinating figure in his own right, he was not involved in the conflict between Ethiopia and Italy.
20 True ['Absolution'] The word you're looking for is "absolution."

It's important to note that the novel is a work of fiction, and Moll Flanders is a character created by Defoe.
25 False ['Extant'] The answer to the riddle is "Exhibit." The reasoning behind this is that an "Ex" in the context of the riddle refers to something that has been, but is no longer, in a relationship or state of being. In this case, the "Ex" is still existing as an artwork, which has been preserved and not lost over the centuries. Therefore, the answer is "Exhibit," as it is something that was once new and is now displayed as an artifact or piece of art.
26 True ['Desperado'] The middle film of Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi trilogy is "Desperado," which is also the title of an Eagles hit song.

34 True ['Nader'] 97,488 is the number of votes that Ralph Nader, a candidate from the Green Party, received in the 2000 Florida presidential election. This election is famous for its close results and the controversy surrounding the recount of votes. George W. Bush won the state by a margin of only 537 votes over Al Gore, which was crucial because Florida's 25 electoral votes were enough to give Bush the victory in the Electoral College. The close results and the controversy surrounding the recount led to a Supreme Court case, Bush v. Gore, which ultimately decided the outcome of the election.
35 True ['Jill Scott'] 1. The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is a series of novels by Alexander McCall Smith, which was adapted into a television series of the same name.

36 True ['Constantine'] 312 A.D is the year associated with the famous Battle of the Milvian Bridge, where the Roman Emperor Constantine I is said to have experienced a divine vision. According to the story, Constantine saw a cross of light in the sky, accompanied by the words "By this sign, conquer" (in Latin, "In hoc signo vinces"). This vision led Constantine to convert to Christianity and adopt the cross as his standard, which he used in the battle against his rival Maxentius. After his victory, Constantine became the sole ruler of the Western Roman Empire and played a significant role in the spread of Christianity. However, it's important to note that the historical accuracy of this story is debated among scholars.
37 True ['Ardern'] 2023 has not yet arrived, so I cannot provide you with the name of the 42-year-old Prime Minister of New Zealand who made a surprise announcement about leaving the job in that year.

38 True ['Fossa'] The carnivore with retractable claws that is depicted as not being terrifying to lemurs in the animated film "Madagascar" is the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). The fossa is a mammal native to Madagascar and is the largest carnivore on the island. It is related to the mongoose family and is known for its agility and ability to climb trees. In the film, the fossa are portrayed as the main predators of the lemurs, but they are not shown as being particularly frightening or menacing. Instead, they are depicted as being more mischievous and playful, which is not an accurate representation of their behavior in the wild. In reality, the fossa is a skilled hunter and is an important predator in the Madagascar ecosystem.
39 False ['Ensconced'] 1. The word you're looking for is "fixed." A fixed light fixture is one that is permanently attached to a surface and not meant to be moved. It is settled in place and not going anywhere.
40 False ['The Power of the Dog'] Anthrax is not weaponized against Benedict Cumberbatch in any 2021 western. There is no record of such a movie being released. The question seems to be a mix of unrelated elements. Anthrax is a serious disease that affects both humans and animals, and it is not something to be taken lightly or used as a weapon. If you have any concerns about anthrax or other diseases, please consult a reliable medical source.
41 True ['The Turn of the Screw'] indeed, you are correct! Peter Quint is a ghostly character in Benjamin Britten's opera "The Turn of the Screw," which is based on the novella of the same name by Henry James. The opera, like the novella, tells the story of a governess who is hired to take care of two young children at a remote country estate, only to be haunted by the ghosts of Quint and another former employee, Miss Jessel.

42 True ['Night Vale'] Will Wheaton does not play a chef at a restaurant called Tourniquet on the podcast "Welcome to Night Vale." In fact, there is no character named Will Wheaton or a restaurant called Tourniquet in the podcast. "Welcome to Night Vale" is a popular podcast that presents itself as a community radio broadcast from the fictional desert town of Night Vale, where all sorts of strange and supernatural events occur. Will Wheaton, the actor known for his roles in "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "The Big Bang Theory," has not appeared as a guest or a voice actor on the podcast.
43 True ['Chisholm'] 1972 was an important year in the history of the United States as it marked the first time a woman won a significant number of delegates in a major party's presidential nomination process. The woman you're referring to is Shirley Chisholm.

Shirley Chisholm was a Democratic representative from New York who made history by becoming the first African American woman elected to Congress in 1968. In 1972, she became the first major-party African American candidate for President of the United States and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.

Chisholm's campaign was groundbreaking, as she advocated for the rights of minorities, women, and the poor. Despite facing significant discrimination and obstacles, she won 152 delegates before withdrawing from the race. Although she did not win the nomination, her campaign left a lasting impact on American politics and paved the way for future women and minority candidates.
44 False ['Jacobs Ladder'] The high-voltage traveling arc you're referring to is commonly known as a "Jacob's Ladder." This is an electrical demonstration device that features two electrodes from which a spark jumps, creating an arc that appears to climb up the ladder-like structure. The name "Jacob's Ladder" is derived from the biblical story of Jacob's dream, in which he saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. However, it's important to note that the term "ionized air" is not typically used in the context of a Jacob's Ladder. Instead, the device works by ionizing the air between the electrodes, creating a conductive path for the electrical current.
45 True ['The Metro'] éxtasis de la luz en la noche de verano (Ezra Pound)

The poem "In a Station of the Metro" by Ezra Pound is often referred to as the first Imagist poem. The full poem is:

The apparition of these faces in the crowd:

la luz se derrama
como un río de oro
sobre las rocas y los árboles
y las hojas se tiñen
de un verde intenso
y las flores se abren
y los pájaros cantan
y todo es luz y vida
y éxtasis.

The poem translates to:

Ecstasy of light in the summer night
on the mountain peak
the light spills
like a river of gold
over the rocks and trees
and the leaves are dyed
a deep green
and the flowers open
and the birds sing
and everything is light and life
and ecstasy.

Both poems showcase Pound's skill as a poet and his ability to capture the beauty and wonder of the natural world in just a few lines.
46 True ["Harry's House"] The possessive title of the third solo pop music album by Mr. Styles would be "Harry's House." This is because "Harry's House" is the name of Harry Styles' third studio album, which was released in May 2022. The album has been well-received by critics and fans alike, and it features hit singles such as "As It Was" and "Late Night Talking." The title "Harry's House" suggests a sense of intimacy and personal expression, as if the listener is being invited into Styles' own private space. Overall, "Harry's House" is a strong addition to Styles' discography, and it showcases his growth as an artist and songwriter.
47 True ['Eroica'] The correct answer is "Erotica section." If you remove one letter from "Erotica," it will become "Eroica," which is the title of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3. This symphony is considered a groundbreaking composition that marks the beginning of Beethoven's romantic period. The name "Eroica" means "heroic" in Italian, and the symphony was originally dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte, whom Beethoven admired as a hero of the French Revolution. However, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor, Beethoven became disillusioned and changed the dedication to "to the memory of a great man."

49 True ['Pillars of Hercules', 'Hercules'] 🇪🇸 Spain's flag features emblems of its historic kingdoms, including the Castle of Castile and the Lion of León, as well as the Pillars of Hercules astride the Strait of Gibraltar. The Pillars of Hercules are a classical symbol of the ancient Greek mythological figure, Hercules, and represent the two mountains that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The pillars are often depicted with the Latin phrase "Non Plus Ultra," meaning "nothing further beyond," which was a warning to sailors not to venture beyond the known world. However, after the discovery of the Americas, the phrase was changed to "Plus Ultra," meaning "further beyond," to symbolize Spain's expansion and exploration of the New World.
50 True ['Crohn'] 1967 was the year when the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, then known as the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis, held a dance featuring Ella Fitzgerald to honor Dr. Burrill B. Crohn. Dr. Crohn was a renowned gastroenterologist who first described the disease that now bears his name. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to finding cures for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and to improving the quality of life of children and adults affected by these diseases.
51 True ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] 1. Upswing: This refers to a period of economic growth and expansion, during which business activity is strong and unemployment is low. It is often characterized by increased consumer confidence, rising stock prices, and increased investment in new projects.

52 True ['Lisbon'] indeed, King Carlos I of Portugal and his son, Luis Filipe, were assassinated in the capital city of Lisbon in 1908. Joao Franco was a Portuguese politician who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1906 to 1908. He was known for his authoritarian rule and had ceded immense power to himself, which led to political instability and social unrest in the country. The assassination of King Carlos I and his son was a tragic event that marked the beginning of the end of the Portuguese monarchy and the establishment of the Portuguese Republic in 1910.
53 False ['Jubjub'] 1. "Beware the Jabberwock, my son" is the first line of the poem "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll, which appears in his novel "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There." The poem is famous for its use of nonsense words, including "Jabberwock," which is a fearsome creature that the protagonist is warned about.

2. The bird that repeats itself and is not found in any ornithological books is the "Jabberwock" from the same poem. The Jabberwock is a fictional creature and not a real bird, so it would not be found in any ornithological books. The poem describes the Jabberwock as having "jaws that bite" and "claws that catch," and it is ultimately slain by the protagonist using a "vorpal sword." The Jabberwock is one of the most famous creatures from Carroll's works and has become a cultural icon.
54 True ['Inigo Jones'] The person you're referring to is Inigo Jones. He was a British architect who is indeed often referred to as England's first great architect. He is known for introducing the classical architecture of Italy to England. The Queen's House, which he began work on in 1616, is considered England's first classical building. It was designed as a private residence for Anne of Denmark, the queen of King James I.
55 True ['Revolutionary Road'] The novel in question is "Revolutionary Road" by Richard Yates. The title is a reference to the American Revolution of 1776, and Yates himself explained that the title was meant to suggest that the revolutionary spirit and promise of 1776 had hit a dead end by the 1950s, the time period in which the novel is set. The novel explores the lives of the Wheelers, a couple living in suburban Connecticut, who are struggling to find meaning and fulfillment in their lives, and who ultimately fail to break free from the constraints of their society. The title thus reflects the sense of stagnation and disappointment that pervades the novel.
56 True ['medulla oblongata'] The lowest part of the brain stem is called the medulla oblongata. It is a small structure located at the lower part of the brainstem, just above the spinal cord. The medulla oblongata plays a crucial role in regulating many vital functions of the body, such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. It also serves as a relay station for nerve impulses traveling between the brain and the rest of the body.
57 True ['Kool Herc'] 1973 is often considered the birth year of Hip-Hop, as it was the year of the famous party DJed by Clive Campbell, also known as DJ Kool Herc. He is credited with helping to originate hip-hop music in the Bronx, New York City. The name you're referring to is likely "Hercules," which is the name Clive Campbell used as a nod to his strength and size, inspired by the mythical strongman of the same name. So, the connection is that DJ Kool Herc, whose party in 1973 is often considered the birth of Hip-Hop, used the name Hercules, inspired by the mythical strongman.
58 False ['Cuspidor'] Indeed, the anagram for "Crisp Duo" is "Spittingly." An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. In this case, the letters in "Crisp Duo" can be rearranged to form "Spittingly." It's a fun and creative way to play with language!
59 True ['Giraffe'] 1. The amble is not the name of the walk used by Okapis. Okapis, like many other mammals, use a variety of gaits including walking, trotting, and galloping. The amble is a specific type of gait that is often used by camels and some other large animals, but it is not typically used by okapis.
2. The relative you are referring to is likely the giraffe. Giraffes are known for their unique gait, in which they move both legs on the same side of their body forward at the same time. This is different from most other mammals, which move their legs in a diagonal pattern (i.e., the left front leg and right hind leg move forward at the same time, followed by the right front leg and left hind leg). This unique gait allows giraffes to cover a lot of ground quickly and efficiently, despite their long legs and neck. Okapis, which are closely related to giraffes, do not use this gait.

70 True ['Templar'] 1310 is the correct year, but it was not the Knights who were tried for heresy and burned at the stake. It was the Knights Templar, a Catholic military order that was accused of heresy by King Philip IV of France. The trials and subsequent burning of many Templars at the stake in Paris marked the beginning of the end of the order. The Knights Templar were officially dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312.
71 False ['Coulis'] The sauce you're referring to is most likely a "compote." A compote is a dessert that involves slow-cooking fruit in a sugar syrup, often with various spices. The fruit is cooked until it becomes soft and the syrup thickens. After cooking, the fruit can be pureed and strained to create a smooth sauce, which is also called a compote. This sauce can be served over various desserts or used as a filling.

The word "compote" ends with a silent "e," which is a common feature in English spelling. The silent "e" at the end of a word often changes the pronunciation of the preceding vowel, but in this case, it does not affect the pronunciation of the "o" in "compote."
72 True ['William Faulkner'] The Compson brothers - Benjy, Quentin, and Jason - are characters from the novel "The Sound and the Fury" by William Faulkner. William Faulkner was a Nobel Prize-winning American novelist and short-story writer.

77 True ['Olympus'] If I were to become a fitfluencer and travel to Mars, I would definitely want to challenge myself by climbing Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. Standing at approximately 13.6 miles high, it's nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. The opportunity to explore and conquer such a monumental natural wonder would be an incredible experience and a great way to inspire others to push their limits and stay active. However, it's important to note that the Martian environment is extremely harsh and unforgiving, so proper training, equipment, and safety measures would be essential for such an endeavor.
78 True ['Groundlings'] In the Globe Theater during Shakespeare's time, the area where the audience could stand in front of the stage was called the "yard." This area was also known as the "pit."

Josef Kaiser is an Austrian designer who created the common side of the Euro coins, which is used by all Eurozone countries.

He designed the Austrian Euro coins, including the 1 Euro coin, which features Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
80 True ['November Rain'] I believe you are referencing the Guns N' Roses song "November Rain." The title of the song suggests that the events described in the lyrics take place in the month of November.

It is a power ballad that explores themes of love, loss, and the transient nature of life. The song's title and lyrics suggest that the weather may be rainy or stormy, but this is open to interpretation and is not explicitly stated in the song.

This phrase is from Henry David Thoreau's book "Walden; or, Life in the Woods," which was published in 1854. The full sentence is: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

During his journey, he hears about the company's highly respected agent, Mr. Kurtz, who is known for his success in gathering ivory. As Marlow travels deeper into the heart of the African continent, he learns more about Kurtz and the true nature of the company's operations, which involve the exploitation and brutalization of the local population. This experience leads Marlow to question the supposed superiority and civilization of the Western world.
87 True ['Gallium'] The mini robot you're referring to is not made of Gallium (symbol Ga), but rather a magnetic alloy called Nizin, which is a combination of Nickel and Zinc. The robot is capable of changing its shape due to the unique properties of this alloy. Gallium, while having a low melting point, is not suitable for creating such a robot due to its toxicity and its tendency to form a thin layer of oxide on its surface when exposed to air, which would hinder its ability to change shape smoothly.
88 True ['Fancy Free'] 1944's "Fancy Free" is the ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins that ends with 'ree' and is about 3 footloose sailors 'On The Town'. This ballet marked Robbins' first foray into choreography and was later adapted into a Broadway musical and a film, both of which were also well-received. The story revolves around three sailors on a 24-hour leave in New York City, who are eager to explore and have a good time. The ballet's lively and energetic choreography, combined with its humorous and engaging storyline, made it an instant hit and established Robbins as a major force in the world of dance.
89 True ['Justinian'] The 6th century outbreak of Bubonic Plague you're referring to is known as the Plague of Justinian, named after the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.

The plague is believed to have originated in China and spread to the Mediterranean via trade routes, ultimately reaching Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, in 541 AD.
90 True ['Pensacola'] The Spanish expedition you're referring to is likely the one led by Tristán de Luna y Arellano. In 1559, they established a settlement near the western end of Florida's Panhandle, which is present-day Pensacola. However, the settlement was short-lived due to a hurricane and other challenges, and the Spanish eventually abandoned it.
91 True ['Avogadro'] The law you're referring to is known as Avogadro's Law. It was named after Amedeo Avogadro, an Italian scientist who first proposed it in 1811. The law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. This means that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas present in the container, given that the temperature and pressure remain constant. The number of molecules in one mole of a gas is known as Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 molecules per mole.
92 True ['Tequila'] The song you're referring to is "Tequila" by The Champs. It was indeed a hit in 1958 and is known for its catchy saxophone melody and the repeated lyric "Tequila!" at the end of the song. Despite its simplicity, the song has become a classic and is still widely recognized today.
93 True ['August Strindberg'] 1884 was the year when "Married" (Swedish: "Giftas"), a collection of short stories by August Strindberg, was published. August Strindberg was a Swedish playwright, novelist, and essayist. The book "Married" caused an uproar in Sweden due to its critical portrayal of marriage and the church, leading to Strindberg being prosecuted for blasphemy. However, it's important to note that the blasphemy charges were not directly related to the book "Married" but rather to his play "The Redemption of a Scoundrel" (Swedish: "Skandalskrinet"). Nonetheless, the controversy surrounding "Married" contributed to the negative attention Strindberg received during this period.
94 True ['Freebooter'] The answer to the riddle is "a boot." The reasoning behind this is that a pirate might be associated with the term "freebooter," which sounds like "free boot," and a boot is a type of shoe.
95 True ['Bhutan'] The "Thunder Dragon" Kingdom you're referring to is Bhutan, a country known for its unique culture and stunning landscapes. Gangkhar Puensum, which stands at approximately 24,980 feet, is indeed the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. It's located in Bhutan, near the border with China. The mountain has never been successfully ascended due to its challenging terrain and the strict regulations imposed by the Bhutanese government to protect the environment and respect local spiritual beliefs.
96 True ['Moravia'] Moravia

The correct region that is mentioned in the preamble to the Czech Constitution, along with Bohemia and Silesia, is Moravia. The preamble refers to these three historic lands that make up the Czech Republic. Moravia is located in the eastern part of the country, while Bohemia is in the west and Silesia is in the northeast.

98 True ['Sphynx'] The hairless cat breed that originated in Canada during the 20th century is called the Sphynx. The breed began with a kitten named Prune, who was born in Toronto in 1966. Prune had a natural genetic mutation that caused its hairlessness. Breeders later crossed Prune's lineage with that of other cats to create the Sphynx breed we know today. Despite their lack of fur, Sphynx cats are not hypoallergenic, as they still produce the allergenic protein, Fel d 1, in their saliva and skin.
99 True ['Vorpal Sword'] In Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" (2010), Alice slays the Jabberwocky with the Vorpal Sword. This is a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky" from his novel "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There," where the Vorpal Sword is also used to slay the Jabberwocky. The phrase "Callooh! Callay!" is part of the poem, expressing joy and triumph after the Jabberwocky is defeated.
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome is credited for translating the Bible into Latin, a version known as the Vulgate. The term "Vulgate" comes from the Latin vulgatus, meaning "common" or "vulgar," indicating that it was intended for general use. St. Jerome's Vulgate, completed around 405 AD, was a significant achievement as it provided a standardized Latin translation of the Bible, which was widely used in the Western Church for many centuries. However, it's important to note that the Vulgate is not the only translation of the Bible with a middle 'G'. There are many other translations with a middle 'G' in their names, such as the Good News Translation (GNT) or the God's Word Translation (GW).
101 True ['Eisenhower'] The president who increased the minimum wage to $1 was Dwight D. Eisenhower. He signed the Minimum Wage Law in 1955, which raised the minimum wage from $0.75 to $1 per hour.

The same president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, also approved and opened the St. Lawrence Seaway. The seaway is a system of locks, canals, and channels that allows ocean-going ships to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, and it was officially opened on June 26, 1959.
102 True ['Bret Easton Ellis'] indeed, 'Less than Zero' is a novel that depicts the indulgent and aimless lives of wealthy young adults in 1980s Los Angeles. The author of this compelling work is Bret Easton Ellis, an American writer known for his provocative and often controversial explorations of consumerism, youth culture, and violence. Published in 1985, 'Less than Zero' was Ellis's debut novel, written when he was just 21 years old. The book's title is derived from a song by the British rock band Elvis Costello, which shares the same name. 'Less than Zero' not only offers a captivating glimpse into the excesses and emptiness of the privileged youth in Los Angeles but also serves as a critique of the societal values and moral decay that permeate their world.
103 True ['Kent'] The white cliffs of Dover are located along the coast of Kent, a county in southeastern England. They are one of England's most famous natural landmarks and are often seen as the first or last sight of the country for travelers crossing the English Channel.

104 True ['Florence Pugh'] Toby Sebastian is the brother of actress Florence Pugh, who has appeared in films such as "Don't Worry Darling," "Little Women," and "Black Widow." Their brother, Sebastian, is also an actor, known for his role as Trystane Martell in the HBO series "Game of Thrones." The three siblings share a close bond and have often spoken about their support for each other's careers.
105 False ['Ha Ha'] The name of the sunken fence used at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's plantation, was called a "ha-ha." This term is believed to have originated from the unexpected reaction of someone coming across it, exclaiming "ha-ha!" in surprise. The ha-ha was designed to provide an unobstructed view of the landscape while keeping livestock from wandering into the residential area. It's a type of fence that is sunk into the ground, creating a barrier that is not visible from a distance.
106 True ['Venerate'] The word you're looking for is "venerate." It comes from the Latin word "venus," which means "love," and "vir," which means "man." Over time, it evolved to mean a deep respect or reverence for something or someone, often associated with religious or highly valued cultural figures or objects.
107 True ['Flagella', 'Flagellum', 'Flagellin'] The parts of a bacterial cell that provide motility are called flagella, not to be confused with cilia which are similar structures found in eukaryotic cells. Flagella are long, whip-like structures that protrude from the bacterial cell surface and help the bacterium to move around. They are composed of a protein called flagellin and are powered by a rotary motor at their base. Some bacteria have a single flagellum, while others have multiple flagella that can be arranged in various patterns around the cell.
108 True ['Bill Hodges'] ✗ Incorrect: The Bill Hodges Trilogy

The correct answer is: The Outsider Series

'Finders Keepers' is the second book in The Outsider series by Stephen King, not the Bill Hodges Trilogy. The first book in the series is 'Mr. Mercedes', and the third book is 'End of Watch'. The Bill Hodges Trilogy consists of 'Mr. Mercedes', 'Finders Keepers', and 'End of Watch', but 'The Outsider' is a separate book that shares some characters with the trilogy.
109 True ['Manila'] John Basilone was a United States Marine who received the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. However, he did not serve in the Philippines in the 1930s. Basilone's nickname was "Manila John" because he had served in the Philippines before the war and had been awarded the Navy Cross for his actions there. The "Manila" part of his nickname refers to the capital city of the Philippines.
110 True ['Io'] Io, Jupiter's moon, is known for its extensive volcanic activity. However, I cannot confirm that Juno spacecraft captured an infrared image of Io's volcanoes in 2022, as I don't have real-time data or access to recent news. I recommend checking the latest news from a reliable space exploration source to verify this information.
111 True ['NewsRadio'] The sitcom you're referring to is "NewsRadio." Phil Hartman, known for his work on "Saturday Night Live," voiced the character Bill McNeal in this 1990s sitcom.

Hartman's performance was highly appreciated and added a unique humor to the show.
112 True ['hermeneutics'] The branch of theology dealing with the interpretation of biblical texts is called "Hermeneutics."

It involves various techniques and principles to understand and explain the meaning of the scriptures.
113 True ['Pascal'] 1642 is the year when Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher, invented the Pascaline, also known as the arithmetic machine. This was one of the first mechanical calculators in history. Pascal was only 19 years old when he invented this device to help his father, a tax collector, with his work. The Pascaline could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Although it was not the first calculating device ever made, it was a significant improvement over its predecessors. The term "Pascal's triangle," a triangular array of binomial coefficients, is also named after him.

Colleen Hoover is a bestselling author known for her romantic novels.
115 False ['Rhode Island'] Jackie and JFK, at St. Mary's Church, refers to Jacqueline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. However, there is no widely known or documented event involving both of them at a St. Mary's Church near a Hammersmith farm.

The Kennedy family did have a connection to Massachusetts, specifically in the town of Brookline where JFK was born and spent his early childhood. There is a St. Mary's Church in Brookline, but it's not near a Hammersmith farm.

Without more specific information, it's not possible to accurately determine the state you're asking about. Please provide more details if you're referring to a different event or location.
116 True ['Stalingrad'] The city you're referring to is Stalingrad, known today as Volgograd. The Battle of Stalingrad was a turning point in World War II, where the Soviet Union was able to halt the Nazi invasion. The battle was marked by intense urban combat, and it ended with the surrender of two German armies on February 2, 1943. This victory had significant strategic and psychological implications, boosting the morale of the Soviet forces and demonstrating that the Nazis could be defeated.
117 True ['Karma Chameleon'] The song you're referring to is "Karma Chameleon" by Culture Club, not "Animal Rock." Boy George was the lead singer of Culture Club, and "Karma Chameleon" was one of their biggest hits. The lyrics go "Desert loving in your eyes all the way," not "You come and go, you come and go." The confusion might be due to the similar-sounding phrases.
118 True ['Hagiography'] The word you're looking for is "hagiography." It originally referred to the biographies of saints, but now it's often used to describe an overly flattering or idealized account of someone's life.
119 True ['Potsdam'] 1. The residence you're referring to is likely the Berlin City Palace, which was a primary residence of the Elector of Brandenburg.
2. During World War II, a conference was held in a different city, not Berlin. The city that got the vote to be the site of this conference was Potsdam, which is also in Germany.
3. The Potsdam Conference was held from July 17 to August 2, 1945, and it was attended by the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, the United States' Harry S. Truman, and the United Kingdom's Winston Churchill (and later Clement Attlee). The conference was held to discuss the post-war reorganization of Europe and to determine the fate of Germany.
120 True ['Francis Bacon'] 17th century English essayist and Lord Chancellor Francis Bacon shares the same first and last name with 20th century British painter and illustrator Francis Bacon. However, it's important to note that the two are not the same person, as they lived in different centuries and had different professions. The 20th century Francis Bacon is known for his unique and often disturbing figurative paintings, while the 17th century Francis Bacon was a philosopher, statesman, scientist, and author, who made significant contributions to the scientific revolution.
121 True ['Calypso'] Odysseus's son, Telemachus, visited the nymph Calypso, who is known for her role in Homer's "Odyssey." Calypso detained Odysseus on her island for seven years, and Telemachus, along with the goddess Athena in disguise, visited her to gather information about Odysseus's whereabouts. The name Calypso is also associated with a music style, particularly a genre of Afro-Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago. Angelica Kauffmann, a Swiss Neoclassical painter, did not depict Telemachus's visit to Calypso, but she did create a painting titled "Telemachus and the Nymphs of Calypso," which shows Telemachus with the nymphs of Calypso's island, not Calypso herself.
122 True ['The Thing'] 1982's "The Thing" is the movie you're referring to. Directed by John Carpenter, this film features a shape-shifting alien that terrorizes a research team in Antarctica, with Kurt Russell playing the role of the helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady. The movie is known for its impressive practical effects and intense, suspenseful atmosphere. It's a classic in the sci-fi horror genre.
123 False ['Sir James Dewar'] The answer to the riddle is a "still." The reasoning behind this is that the term "Sir James" is a play on words, as "still" can be pronounced similarly to "steel," which is a type of metal. The second line, "who / 'Is a better man than you are," is a humorous way of saying that the still is superior to the listener in its ability to liquefy gases. The last two lines, "None of you asses / Can liquefy gases," further emphasize the still's unique ability to turn gases into liquids.
124 True ['Cold Open'] Sure, I can help with that. The part of the show you're referring to is called a "cold open." It's a common feature in many television shows, not just "Saturday Night Live." A cold open is a scene that appears before the opening credits or titles, and it's designed to immediately engage the audience in the show.

In the case of "Saturday Night Live," the cold open often consists of a comedic sketch that satirizes current events or popular culture. These sketches frequently feature guest stars or cast members playing well-known figures, such as politicians or celebrities. The cold open is a long-standing tradition on "Saturday Night Live," and it's often one of the most anticipated parts of the show.
125 True ['Tom Jones'] ¡Hello there! It seems like you're asking about a memorable moment on "The Voice UK" involving a Welsh legend. The incident you're referring to is when Sir Tom Jones, a Welsh singer and coach on the show, unexpectedly joined Jennifer Hudson in a duet of "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" during the blind auditions in 2017.

126 True ['Windward'] The passage you're referring to is likely the Windward Passage, which is located between the western end of Hispaniola (specifically, the western tip of Haiti) and the eastern coast of Cuba.

As for the same-named islands located further southeast, I believe you are referring to the Turks and Caicos Islands. These islands are located in the Atlantic Ocean, southeast of the Windward Passage. The Turks and Caicos Islands are a British Overseas Territory, and they are known for their beautiful beaches and clear waters. The name "Turks" is believed to come from the indigenous Turk's head cactus found on the islands, while "Caicos" comes from the Lucayan term "caya hico," meaning "string of islands."

128 True ['peristaltic', 'peristalsis'] Yes, during pregnancy, the body undergoes many changes, including an increase in the hormone progesterone. This hormone causes the muscles in the body to relax, including the muscles of the digestive tract. As a result, the waves of muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract, known as peristalsis, slow down. This can cause food to stay in the stomach longer, leading to heartburn and indigestion. Additionally, as the uterus grows, it can put pressure on the stomach, pushing stomach acid up into the esophagus and causing heartburn.
129 True ['The Unbearable Lightness of Being'] 💡 The novel you're referring to is "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Milan Kundera.

The novel is known for its unique style, blending elements of existentialism, eroticism, and political commentary.
130 True ['endoskeleton'] The internal supporting structure of vertebrates is called the endoskeleton. This is a 12-letter word that fits your criteria. The endoskeleton is made up of bones, cartilage, and other connective tissues that provide support, protection, and structure to the body. It also allows for movement, as the bones act as levers for the muscles to pull against. The endoskeleton is a defining characteristic of vertebrates, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
131 True ['Luminosity'] "Sunlight's Tint" could be an astronomical anagram for "Mutiny Oils" that relates to a star's brightness. The brightness of a star can be described as its luminosity, which is the total amount of energy emitted by the star per unit time. The anagram "Sunlight's Tint" suggests the idea of the sun's light being filtered or tinted, which could be a metaphor for the way that a star's brightness can be affected by interstellar dust and gas, which can absorb or scatter some of the star's light and cause it to appear dimmer or redder.
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] BRMC stands for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, an American rock band that was formed in San Francisco in 1998.

133 False ['Yellen'] The phrase "bank on" in your question seems to suggest a connection to finance or economics. The successor of a president could refer to a vice president or a subsequent president. An ex-FED chair could refer to a former chair of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States.

If you're referring to the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, his vice president was Joe Biden, who is now the 46th President. However, Biden has not served as a FED chair.

If you're referring to the 41st President of the United States, George H.W. Bush, his successor was Bill Clinton, and Clinton's vice president was Al Gore. Neither Clinton nor Gore have served as a FED chair.

Therefore, it's a bit unclear who you're asking about. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?

On his 30th birthday, he experiences an arrested development, and legal issues begin to surface. By the time he turns 31, his life is far from the letter-perfect existence he had been portraying.

The term "Kafka-esque" is used to describe situations that are disorienting or oppressive, often with a sense of surrealism or bureaucracy. Don Draper's life, with its complex web of secrets, identity issues, and the struggle to maintain a perfect facade, can indeed be described as Kafka-esque.
136 True ['Animorphs'] Sure, I can help with that! The book series you're referring to is "Animorphs," which was written by K.A. Applegate and published in the 1990s.

141 True ['Formosa'] 18th-century France was a time of great curiosity and fascination with the exotic and unknown.

It is usually performed under general anesthesia and requires careful monitoring and management by a team of medical professionals.

The members of this group were Mily Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Alexander Borodin.

So, the counterpart to Moscow composers like Tchaikovsky would be Rimsky-Korsakov, who was also a member of "The Five." He was a prominent figure in the group and played a significant role in shaping the direction of Russian classical music.

This medication marked a significant turning point in the treatment of mental illness, particularly for patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In the film "Shutter Island," set in 1954, it is possible that Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley, would have been aware of and hopeful about the potential benefits of this new medication. However, the film does not explicitly mention Chlorpromazine or any specific anti-psychotic medication.

172 True ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] 1. The English equivalent of the Italian saying 'a caval donato non si guarda in bocca' is "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
2. This idiom is used to advise people not to be ungrateful or overly critical when receiving a gift or favor.
3. The phrase "don't look a gift horse in the mouth" comes from the practice of determining the age of a horse by looking at its teeth, which is considered impolite when the horse is a gift.

So, the English equivalent of 'a caval donato non si guarda in bocca' is "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth," which conveys the same message of gratitude and appreciation for gifts or favors received.
173 True ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 1926 Balfour Report, named after Lord President of the Council Arthur James Balfour, was a significant document in the evolution of the British Commonwealth.

177 True ['Prometheus'] The titan you're referring to is Prometheus. According to Greek mythology, Prometheus was known for his sympathy towards mankind. He defied Zeus by stealing fire from the gods and giving it to humans, an act which is often symbolized as the spark of human civilization and knowledge. As a punishment, Zeus chained Prometheus to a mountain, where an eagle would eat his liver every day, only for it to regenerate overnight due to his immortality. This punishment was indeed a dark turn after Prometheus had "lit" the way for mankind.
178 True ['plethora'] (Pleroma) - While the Greek word "pleroma" does indeed mean "fullness," it is not an English word and does not have an eight-letter English equivalent that means "overabundance."

179 True ['As you Like It'] The speech containing the line "My Brother Jaques He keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit" is from Shakespeare's play "As You Like It."

To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine

Or, to speak more properly, hath kept me here
In the remembrance of things long past,
Wherein I see myself—"

A parsec is defined as the distance at which the average star would have a parallax of one second of arc.
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] The crossover movie you're referring to is "Freddy vs. Jason" (2003), which features the iconic horror character Jason Voorhees from the "Friday the 13th" series. The Robin Williams woman who enjoys a cake moisturizer is a reference to the character Samantha (played by Meredith Salenger) from the movie "The Bicentennial Man" (1999). In this film, Samantha has a fondness for a moisturizer that smells like cake.

However, there is no direct comparison or interaction between Jason Voorhees and Samantha in any movie. The connection between these two characters is a result of a creative and humorous interpretation of the question, which combines two unrelated movies in an imaginative way.
185 False ['Library Paste'] The "old LP" you're referring to is likely a long-playing (LP) vinyl record. However, the thick white adhesive used for bookbinding is called "bookbinder's glue" or "PVA glue" (Polyvinyl Acetate).

"But now the ship has veer'd about,
With the sun, as he westward went,
And the steersman, with a bitter shout,
Turn'd the ship round to south-east and west.
And we, with the wind at will,
Onward and on we sped,
And I, as a child, with a child's heart,
Gazed, and gazed on the living clouds,
And the living clouds, they seem'd to dance."
187 False ['Montserrat'] 1493 is the year when Christopher Columbus named the volcanic island of Saint Kitts, which is located in the West Indies.

Cromwell was a key figure in the Parliamentarian cause during the English Civil War, which pitted the forces of King Charles I against those of the English Parliament. The war was fought over issues of religious freedom, constitutional government, and the balance of power between the king and Parliament.

After the Parliamentarian victory in the war, Charles I was put on trial for treason and other high crimes. Cromwell was a member of the court that tried the king and ultimately found him guilty. The king was executed in January 1649, and Cromwell played a leading role in the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, a republic that replaced the monarchy.

Cromwell's statement about the "cruel necessity" of the king's execution reflects the fact that, while he believed that the king's actions had made his execution necessary, he also recognized the gravity and tragedy of the situation. Cromwell was a complex figure, and his views on the monarchy and the role of government evolved over time. However, he is generally remembered as a strong leader who was committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of the people of England.

245 False ['Ceres'] 1. The only dwarf planet that orbits the sun closer than Neptune is Pluto. 

Pluto was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system, but it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. Despite this change in classification, Pluto is still the most well-known and studied dwarf planet.

Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, meaning that it varies in distance from the sun. At its closest, Pluto is about 4.4 billion kilometers (2.7 billion miles) from the sun, which is still farther than Neptune's average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles). However, because of Pluto's elliptical orbit, there are times when it is closer to the sun than Neptune.

Pluto's orbit is also inclined relative to the orbits of the other planets, meaning that it does not lie in the same plane as the rest of the solar system. This, combined with its small size and eccentric orbit, led to its reclassification as a dwarf planet.

Other dwarf planets in our solar system include Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, all of which orbit the sun beyond Neptune.

253 True ['factorial'] 3! is indeed the shorthand way of expressing 3 * 2 * 1, and the "!" is called factorial. In mathematics, factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every positive integer less than it, down to 1. So, for any positive integer n, the factorial of n is:

During its peak, the Songhai Empire stretched from the Atlantic coast in the west to the modern-day border of Nigeria in the east, and from the fringes of the Sahara Desert in the north to the forests of Guinea in the south. The empire was known for its sophisticated bureaucracy, advanced trade networks, and rich cultural heritage, which included the famous Timbuktu manuscripts.
256 True ['scallop'] The main ingredient in Coquilles St. Jacques is scallops.

257 True ['mitochondria', 'mitochondrion'] 1957 Scientific American article referred to mitochondria as the "Powerhouse of the Cell". Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. They are often referred to as the "powerhouse" or "energy factory" of the cell because they produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the main source of energy for cellular processes. The article was written by Philip Siekevitz, a prominent cell biologist, and it helped to popularize the term "powerhouse" to describe the important role of mitochondria in cellular energy production.
258 False ['deadlocked'] indestructible

After a titanic struggle, teams might be described as "indestructible" if they remain tied, as this adjective conveys a sense of resilience and strength that is fitting for a closely contested match. Other possible adjectives could include "unyielding," "unbreakable," or "invincible."

261 True ['Orange'] The Ernest Oppenheimer Bridge, which connects South Africa and Namibia, spans the Orange River. This river is not only significant for its vibrant color but also for being the longest river in South Africa, flowing through both countries before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. The bridge, named after the famous mining magnate and philanthropist, serves as an essential link between the two nations, facilitating trade and travel.
262 True ['Charley Pride'] Jimmy Allen's song 'Down Home' does not explicitly mention any trailblazing black country singer who died in 2020. The song is a tribute to his late father, James Allen Sr., and it was released in 2021. There were indeed some notable black country singers who passed away in 2020, such as Charley Pride, but they are not mentioned in this particular song.
263 True ['Minoan'] Yes, that's correct. The Phaistos Disc was discovered in 1908 during an excavation of a palace from the Minoan civilization in Crete. Despite numerous attempts, the disc's unique symbols and language have yet to be deciphered. The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization that arose on the island of Crete and flourished from approximately 2700 to 1450 BCE. The Phaistos Disc is one of the most famous and mysterious artifacts from this civilization, and its meaning and purpose remain a subject of ongoing debate among scholars.
264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker who wrote a multi-volume history of sexuality that discusses power dynamics in society is Michel Foucault. His work, "The History of Sexuality", is a detailed study of the societal attitudes towards sexuality and how it has been used as a means of control and power.

265 True ['Walther'] Walther PPK

In the James Bond series, author Ian Fleming changed Bond's gun from a Beretta to a Walther PPK after receiving a letter from a fan named Geoffrey Boothroyd. Boothroyd, a firearms expert, suggested that the Beretta was not a suitable gun for a secret agent like Bond. He recommended the Walther PPK, a German-made pistol, which he believed was more fitting for Bond's character. Fleming took this advice and incorporated it into the series, making the Walther PPK one of the most iconic elements of the James Bond character.
266 True ['ooze'] The term "Globigerina" is actually related to a type of planktonic foraminifera, which are single-celled organisms that live in the ocean. When these organisms die, their shells accumulate on the ocean floor, contributing to the formation of a type of sediment known as "ooze." 

Globigerina ooze is one of the most common types of ocean sediment, particularly in areas of the ocean where the water is deep and the rate of sediment accumulation is relatively low. It is primarily composed of the calcium carbonate shells of planktonic foraminifera, along with the remains of other marine organisms.

So, while Globigerina ooze does contain dead organisms, it is not accurate to describe it as "gooey mud." Instead, it is a type of sediment that is made up of the hard, calcareous shells of marine organisms.
267 True ['Brave New World'] The novel that the quote "What you need is a gramme of Soma. All the advantages of Christianity and Alcohol - none of their defects" is from is "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley, published in 1932. In the novel, Soma is a drug that is used by the government to control the population and keep them happy and complacent. The quote highlights the idea that Soma provides the positive aspects of religion and alcohol, such as a sense of community and euphoria, without any of the negative consequences.
268 True ['Murray'] 1500 mile long Australian river refers to the Murray River, which is the longest river in Australia. The tributaries of the Murray River include The Darling and The Murrumbidgee rivers. The Murray-Darling basin is one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia, and the rivers are an important source of water for irrigation, as well as being home to a diverse range of plant and animal life.
269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] Yes, that is generally correct. The recovery time for knee surgery can vary depending on the type and severity of the injury, as well as the specific procedure performed. For ligament repairs, such as an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, it is common for the recovery process to take several months to a year or more.

However, the dissolving stitches used in knee surgery are typically designed to be absorbed by the body within a few weeks. This does not mean that the knee is fully healed, but rather that the incision site has healed enough to no longer require the support of the stitches.

It is important to follow your surgeon's post-operative instructions carefully, including attending follow-up appointments, completing physical therapy exercises, and avoiding activities that could compromise the healing process. Your surgeon will be able to provide you with a more specific timeline for your recovery based on your individual situation.
270 True ['Morris'] 19th century arts and crafts movement designer William Morris is known for creating wallpapers such as "Rose and Jasmine."

271 True ['Addams Family Values'] The movie sequel you're referring to is "Addams Family Values" from 1993. In this film, Wednesday and Pugsley Addams are sent to a summer camp called Camp Chippewa. The "before and after" aspect of the title refers to the fact that the film explores the values of the Addams Family in contrast to those of mainstream society, both before and after the children are sent to camp.
272 False ['Done', 'Dun'] Finished and Drab are not homophones. Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. Examples of homophones include "to", "too", and "two", or "there", "their", and "they're".

Finished is pronounced as /ˈfɪnɪʃt/ and means having completed all the necessary tasks or requirements.

Drab is pronounced as /dræb/ and means lacking in brightness, interest, or color.

Since the two words are not pronounced the same, they are not homophones.
273 True ['Zworykin'] 1923 was an important year for television technology, as it was when Vladimir K. Zworykin, a Russian immigrant, filed a patent for the Iconoscope. This invention was a significant step forward in the development of television, as it served as the first practical television transmission tube. Zworykin's Iconoscope converted light into an electronic signal, which could then be transmitted and displayed on a television screen. This innovation laid the groundwork for the television sets that would become a staple in homes around the world in the following decades.
274 False ['Sharp Objects and Gone Girl', 'Sharp Objects Gone Girl'] 1. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" by Stieg Larsson
2. "The Girl Who Played with Fire" by Stieg Larsson

"Sharp Girl" is a two-book set that contains the first two novels in Stieg Larsson's "Millennium" series, featuring the character Lisbeth Salander. The set includes "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and "The Girl Who Played with Fire." The third book in the series, "The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest," is not included in this set.

It takes place in Bayreuth, Germany, and has been a significant platform for Wagner's works since its inception in 1876.

The unique design of the theater, particularly the orchestra pit, allows for a distinctive sound experience that has contributed to the festival's reputation.
276 True ['Hoyle'] 18th century whist expert and author, Edmond Hoyle, is often invoked as a cards authority. His name is frequently used in the phrase "According to Hoyle," which is often said when referring to the rules of card games, even though the rules may have changed since his time. Hoyle was a lawyer and game expert who published "A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist" in 1742, which became a standard reference for the game.
277 True ['Brooklyn Decker'] The actress and model you're referring to is Brooklyn Decker. She is known for her appearances in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, including the cover of the 2010 issue.

In the context of the riddle, a stable is the place where horses are saddled before a race, and it can also be an enclosed space where they are exercised.
279 True ['wasp'] The tarantula hawk is a type of wasp, not a bee. It is known for its unique and fascinating behavior of preying on tarantulas. The female tarantula hawk stings and paralyzes a tarantula, then lays its eggs on the spider's body. When the eggs hatch, the wasp larvae feed on the still-living tarantula. Despite their intimidating name and behavior, tarantula hawks are generally not aggressive towards humans and their sting is considered one of the most painful, but it is not typically dangerous.
280 True ['Cronkite'] 1981 was the year when Walter Cronkite, a prominent news anchor for CBS, stepped down from his position. In 2017, Peter Mansbridge, who was the chief correspondent for CBC News and anchor of "The National", also stepped down. Both Cronkite and Mansbridge were highly respected and long-serving news anchors in their respective countries, and their departures marked significant moments in the history of broadcast journalism. However, the specific role or title that Mansbridge assumed after Cronkite's departure is not clear, as they were both news anchors for different networks in different countries.
281 True ['Graham'] The evangelist you're referring to is most likely Billy Graham. He was known for his large-scale revival meetings, often held in tents, which drew thousands of people. In 1949, he held a series of revival meetings in Los Angeles, California, which gained national attention and were attended by large crowds. However, I don't have specific information about a 1949 article mentioning a particular meeting with more than 20,000 people. But it's possible that such an article exists, given the scale and impact of Graham's revival meetings during that time.
282 True ['Odenkirk'] The actor you're referring to is Bob Odenkirk, who is well-known for his role as the unscrupulous lawyer Saul Goodman in the critically acclaimed series "Breaking Bad" and its spin-off "Better Call Saul," both of which aired on AMC. However, the show you mentioned, "Lucky Hank," is not a real show. It seems there might be some confusion or a typo in your question.

If you're asking about Bob Odenkirk's return to AMC after "Better Call Saul," he is set to star in a new series called "Straight Man." The show is based on the novel of the same name by Richard Russo and will feature Odenkirk as William Henry Devereaux Jr., the unlikely chairman of a college English department. The series is expected to premiere on AMC in 2023.
283 False ['lowkey'] The slang term you're looking for is "lo-key." When used before "goated," it means that something is great or excellent, but in a subtle or understated way. It's similar to "down-low" in the sense that both terms imply a level of discretion or keeping something low-key. However, "lo-key" is more about the quality or nature of the thing being described, while "down-low" is more about the way it's being shared or kept secret.
284 True ['Cloisters'] The novel that Jenna Bush recommended, which is as Gothic as you can get and is named for and set at a branch of the Met dedicated to the art of the Middle Ages, is "The Cloisters" by Sheri Holman.

It is a beautiful and serene location that offers stunning views of Honolulu and the Pacific Ocean. The cemetery is the final resting place for over 50,000 veterans and their family members, and is a popular destination for visitors to Honolulu who wish to pay their respects to those who have served our country.
286 False ['Healall'] The poem "Design" by Robert Frost features the flower known as the "spreading adder" or "wake-robin," which is another name for the common trillium (Trillium grandiflorum). This flower is known for its three-petaled white blossom and is often associated with springtime and renewal. While it does not have any widely recognized curative powers, it is a popular wildflower in North America and is often used in gardens for its attractive appearance. The poem uses the image of the wake-robin to explore themes of design and purpose in nature.

288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] Before: "For a Fistful of Dollars" (1964)
After: "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966)

In "For a Fistful of Dollars," Clint Eastwood's character, known as "The Man with No Name," arrives in a Mexican village where he plays two rival gangs against each other for his own gain. This film is considered the first in the "Dollars Trilogy" directed by Sergio Leone.

In "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach portray three gunslingers who compete to find a cache of Confederate gold during the American Civil War. This film is the third and final installment in the "Dollars Trilogy."

Marlon Brando's film "One-Eyed Jacks" (1961) was released before the "Dollars Trilogy" and does not have a direct connection to the other films. However, it is also a Western that explores themes of revenge and moral ambiguity, similar to the "Dollars Trilogy." In "One-Eyed Jacks," Brando plays a bank robber who seeks revenge against his former partner who betrayed him.
289 True ['Shinto'] Torii gates are a common sight outside of Shinto shrines in Japan, marking the boundary between the secular world and the sacred space of the shrine. Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, and it emphasizes the worship of kami, or spirits, that are believed to exist in nature and in various aspects of life. The "Way of the Gods" is another way to refer to Shinto, and it reflects the belief that following the teachings and practices of Shinto can help individuals live in harmony with the kami and with the natural world.
290 True ['Reposado'] ¡Excelente pregunta! The type of tequila you're referring to is "Reposado." In Spanish, "Reposado" means "rested" or "restful." This tequila is aged in oak barrels for a minimum of two months, but no more than a year. During this time, it develops a golden hue and takes on a smoother, more complex flavor profile compared to Blanco or Plata tequilas, which are not aged. The oak barrels impart a subtle taste of vanilla and caramel, making Reposado tequilas a popular choice for sipping or using in cocktails. ¡Salud!
291 True ['Stockholm'] August Strindberg, a renowned Swedish playwright, novelist, and poet, passed away in Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden, in 1912. His works, often characterized by psychological complexity and a focus on existentialist themes, have left a significant impact on the world of drama. Strindberg's death in Stockholm marked the end of an era in Swedish literature and drama, but his legacy continues to inspire and influence artists worldwide.
292 True ['Hagar'] In the Bible, Sarah, the wife of Abraham, was unable to bear children. She then gave her Egyptian handmaid Hagar to Abraham so that he could have children through her. Hagar bore Ishmael to Abraham. This story can be found in the book of Genesis, chapter 16.
293 True ['Gluon'] Inside protons and neutrons, quarks are bound together by particles called gluons. The name "gluon" reflects their function, as they are responsible for the strong force that "glues" quarks together, holding these particles within the nucleus of an atom. Gluons are massless gauge bosons, which means they are force-carrying particles that mediate the strong interaction between quarks.
294 True ['Tessera', 'Tessellation', 'tessellated'] 1. Tessellation:
While tessellation does refer to the process of creating a mosaic, it specifically pertains to the arrangement of shapes closely fitted together in a repeated pattern without gaps or overlaps. It doesn't necessarily imply the use of small squares or tiles.

The National Recording Registry is a list of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant and are selected for preservation by the Library of Congress.
298 True ['JuJu', 'joujou', 'gris'] In Voodoo shops, you can buy gris-gris bags. These are small bags containing a variety of ingredients such as herbs, oils, stones, and other items believed to have protective or lucky properties. The ingredients and their combinations are often specific to the desired outcome, such as protection, love, or success. The bags are typically worn or carried on the person. However, it's important to note that Voodoo is a religion with a rich culture and history, and these items are used within a specific spiritual context. They are not simply "good luck charms" but are part of a complex belief system.
299 True ['Shelley'] The poet you're referring to is Percy Bysshe Shelley. He was one of the major English Romantic poets, and his work "Unbound" is a reference to his poem "Adonais," a pastoral elegy on the death of John Keats. The line about drowning is a reference to his death at a young age; he drowned in a sailing accident in Italy.
300 True ['Burundi'] The country you're referring to is Burundi, located in the African Great Lakes region. Despite the Hutu majority, the Tutsi minority has historically held power in Burundi, similar to the situation in neighboring Rwanda. This power dynamic has been a significant factor in the country's political and social landscape, contributing to ethnic tensions and conflicts.
301 True ['Carillon'] The word you're looking for is "carillon." A carillon is a musical instrument that consists of at least 23 cast bronze bells, which are played serially to produce a melody or together to create chords.

It was a commercial success and established Melville as a promising new voice in American literature.
305 True ['griot'] The answer to the question is a "Griot." In the film "Night of the Kings," a young prisoner in Abidjan's notorious La MACA prison is chosen to act as a Griot, a West African storyteller, and must spin a tale to stay alive. The tradition of Griots is an important part of West African culture, and they are responsible for preserving and passing down the history, traditions, and stories of their communities. In the film, the young prisoner's story is a captivating and suspenseful tale that keeps the other prisoners engaged and entertained, allowing him to survive another night in the dangerous prison.

307 False ['Marcel'] The answer is "Bob." The term "Bob" refers to both a boy's first name and a popular hairstyling term. However, it has not been a common name in France since the 1920s. The bob haircut, on the other hand, has seen various periods of popularity throughout the world, including France, since its introduction in the 1920s.
308 True ['Livy'] 142 volumes is quite an impressive number, but it's not quite accurate for the work you're referring to. The ancient scholar you're thinking of is Titus Livius, known as Livy in English. He wrote a monumental history of Rome titled "Ab Urbe Condita" (From the Founding of the City), which was divided into 142 books, not volumes. However, it's important to note that not all of these books have survived to the present day.

Livy's work covers the history of Rome from its founding (traditionally dated to 753 BC) up to his own time, which was during the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. His accounts of the battles against Hannibal, a Carthaginian general who posed a significant threat to Rome during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), are among the most famous and vivid parts of his history.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] 1855 Book: "The Voyage of the 'Fox'" by Francis Leopold McClintock

The phrase "Let's head in a certain direction" is not directly related to the title or content of "The Voyage of the 'Fox'." However, the phrase "sail in a certain direction" is sometimes used metaphorically to mean heading towards a specific goal or objective. In this context, the title of the book could be used to convey that meaning.

"The Voyage of the 'Fox'" is a book about a young British sailor, Francis Leopold McClintock, who embarks on a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. The book describes his experiences and observations during the journey, providing a detailed account of life at sea during the mid-19th century. The book is not widely known for coining any specific phrases or idioms, but it is a valuable resource for those interested in maritime history and exploration.
310 True ['Pangaea'] The supercontinent that existed millions of years ago is known as Pangaea, which means "All Earth" in Greek. It started to break apart around 200 million years ago, leading to the formation of the continents as we know them today.
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] 'War Pigs' is a song by the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath. The song, which appears on their 1970 album 'Paranoid', is often interpreted as a critique of the Vietnam War and the politicians who perpetuate war, with the band suggesting that the real evil or "Satanism" is not occult practices but the horrors of war. However, it's important to note that the band members themselves have offered varying interpretations of the song's meaning over the years.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] ¡Hola amigo! It sounds like you're referring to the famous Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas. This quirky public art installation features ten vintage Cadillacs buried nose-first in the ground, with their colorful graffiti-covered bodies sticking up in the air. It's a popular spot for tourists to stop and leave their own mark on the cars with spray paint. Just remember to bring your own can, as there are no vendors on site. And yes, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on your car when visiting any attraction, especially if you're leaving it unattended. Have a great time in Texas!
313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] The exhumation you're referring to is likely that of Tycho Brahe, a renowned 16th century Danish astronomer known for his detailed astronomical and planetary observations. There were rumors that his prosthetic nose, which he wore after losing part of his nose in a duel, was made of gold. However, when his remains were exhumed in 2010, tests revealed that the prosthetic was more likely made of brass or a copper alloy, not gold. This finding debunked the long-standing myth about his golden nose.
314 False ['Peccadillo'] The word you're looking for is "llagrimas" which is the diminutive of "llanto" (crying) in Spanish. However, I believe the word you're looking for is "llorar" which means "to cry" in Spanish. The diminutive of "llorar" is "llorarito" which can be translated to "a little cry" or "a minor fault or quirk related to crying". The term "llagrimas" is not commonly used to describe a minor fault or quirk.
315 True ['Xerxes'] 480 BC was the year of the Battle of Salamis, a significant naval engagement during the Greco-Persian Wars. The Persian ruler at the time was Xerxes I, who was indeed the son of Darius the Great. Xerxes I led the Persian forces in an attempt to conquer Greece, but the Greek city-states, led by Athens and Sparta, managed to repel the invasion. The Battle of Salamis was a turning point in the war, as the Greek navies decisively defeated the Persians, significantly weakening their military capabilities.
316 False ['Air Force Quit'] before: A nation's military planes are in a holding pattern
after: you have to hit a combination of keys on your mac or PC to exit a frozen screensaver

Explanation: The before phrase describes a situation where military planes are circling in a holding pattern, waiting for permission to land. The after phrase describes a common issue with computers where the screensaver freezes and the user has to press a combination of keys to exit it. The two phrases are combined to create a humorous and unexpected contrast.
317 True ['Stevens'] The Anchorage International Airport was renamed in 2000 to honor Ted Stevens, who served as a U.S. Senator from Alaska for over 40 years.

318 False ['The Way Way Back'] 2013 film "The Way, Way Back" refers to a place to sit in a station wagon (a 1970 Buick Estate). The title of the film is a reference to the rear-facing seat in the back of a station wagon, which is where the main character, Duncan, often sits. The film follows Duncan as he navigates a summer vacation with his mother and her overbearing boyfriend, and finds solace and friendship at a local water park. The title of the film is a nod to the idea of finding a place of one's own, even in the most unlikely of places.
319 True ['fenugreek'] The European leaves that are essential to Iran's national dish, Ghormeh Sabzi, are fenugreek leaves. Fenugreek is an herb that is native to Europe and Asia, and its leaves are used extensively in Iranian cuisine, particularly in this traditional stew. The other key ingredients in Ghormeh Sabzi include herbs like parsley, cilantro, and dried leeks, as well as red kidney beans, lamb, and dried limes. The dish is slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together, resulting in a rich, aromatic, and comforting meal.
320 True ['Moldova'] 1991 was a year of significant geopolitical changes, with many nations gaining independence as the Soviet Union dissolved. The country you're referring to is most likely Moldova.

324 True ['greenback'] The 1870s U.S. political party that got its colorful name because it wanted to maintain or increase paper money circulation was the Greenback Party. The name "Greenback" comes from the paper money issued during the Civil War, which was printed in green on the back. The Greenback Party was established in 1874 and advocated for the continued use of these greenbacks as legal tender, rather than returning to a currency backed by gold or silver.

However, modern science has shown that there is no scientific basis for phrenology and that it is not a reliable way to determine personality or mental abilities.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Czechoslovakia

Milan Kundera's novel 'Life is Elsewhere' was not allowed to be published in his home country of Czechoslovakia during the time of its creation. This was due to the political climate and censorship in the country, which viewed the book as critical of the regime. Kundera, a Czech-born French writer, is known for his works that often explore themes of identity, politics, and sexuality.

He was a prominent abolitionist and a member of the Republican Party, serving as a Senator from Massachusetts.

Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, served from 1916 to 1939. Both men had significant impacts on American law and society.
341 True ['atom'] Yes, you're correct. In the early 1900s, the 'Plum Pudding' model of the atom, proposed by J.J. Thomson, was replaced by the planetary model, also known as the Rutherford model. This change occurred due to the results of an experiment conducted by Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in 1909, which suggested that the positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a small, dense nucleus, rather than being evenly distributed throughout the atom as the Plum Pudding model suggested.

The Nikkei 225 is a stock index that consists of 225 of the largest and most liquid stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

The play is part of a trilogy called the "Theban Plays", which also includes "Oedipus Rex" and "Antigone". I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

The word "connoisseur" is often used to describe someone who has a refined or sophisticated taste in a particular area of the arts.
345 True ['Mumbai'] 19th-century British author Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay, now known as Mumbai, India.

However, I cannot confirm this without specific information about the exact location of his birthplace and the current art schools in Mumbai.
346 True ['The Little Foxes'] *"The Little Foxes"* is a play by Lillian Hellman that explores themes of greed and ambition through the story of a southern family plotting to make a fortune. The play was first performed in 1939 and has since become a classic of American drama. It was adapted into a film in 1941, starring Bette Davis. The title of the play comes from a verse in the Song of Solomon in the Bible, which reads, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes." This verse is often interpreted as a warning against the dangers of small, seemingly insignificant sins that can ultimately lead to greater corruption and destruction. In the play, the "little foxes" are the members of the Hubbard family, who are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, no matter the cost to themselves or others.

Despite this, he was able to project an image of strength and vitality, which was a significant factor in his political success. The article suggests that this element of surprise, or "dramatic" quality, can be valuable in politics as it can help to engage and inspire the public.

The lyrics that were later added to this tune to create the German national anthem were written by Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1841. The anthem's first verse, "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles," has been a source of controversy due to its association with Nazi propaganda, and since 1952, only the third verse is officially sung as the German national anthem.

Oxytocin is also known for its role in childbirth and breastfeeding, as it helps to stimulate uterine contractions during labor and milk ejection during breastfeeding.
