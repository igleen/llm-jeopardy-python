0 False ['Bogart'] The last name you're thinking of is 'Brando'. Marlon Brando, the iconic Hollywood actor, shares his last name with the verb "to brandish". While "to brandish" doesn't exactly mean "to hog something," it does mean "to wave or flourish (a weapon, especially) in a threatening or challenging manner." It's not as relevant to the verb's meaning, but the word "brando" is a German noun meaning "firebrand," which could metaphorically imply being hoggish about something.
1 True ['Fiji'] The correct answer is Fiji. This South Pacific country does indeed consist of over 300 islands, but approximately 70% of its population resides on its largest island, Viti Levu. This island is the economic and political hub of Fiji, hosting the capital city of Suva and the largest city, Nadi, which serves as a major gateway for tourists visiting the country.
2 True ['Calder'] Art does not necessarily have to be static, and many artists have explored the use of motion in their work. The idea of incorporating motion into sculpture is not a new one, and there have been many examples of "kinetic art" throughout history.

Some of the earliest examples of kinetic art can be traced back to ancient China, where mechanical toys and automata were created using complex systems of gears and pulleys. In the modern era, artists such as Alexander Calder, George Rickey, and Jean Tinguely are known for their kinetic sculptures, which use motion to create dynamic and engaging works of art.

There are many ways that artists can incorporate motion into their sculptures. Some use motors or other mechanical means to create movement, while others rely on natural forces such as wind or water. Some kinetic sculptures are interactive, allowing viewers to manipulate the movement of the piece through touch or other inputs.

The use of motion in sculpture can add a new dimension to the work, creating a sense of energy and movement that is not possible with static forms. It can also engage viewers in new ways, inviting them to interact with the piece and experience it in a more dynamic and immersive way.

Overall, the idea of incorporating motion into sculpture is an exciting and innovative approach that can add depth and interest to the work. It is a natural evolution of the art form, and one that is sure to continue to inspire and captivate audiences for years to come.
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] Ah, you're diving into the fascinating realm where science and magic intertwine! The substance you're referring to is called the Philosopher's Stone, or in some traditions, the Sorcerer's Stone. This legendary artifact from alchemy was believed to turn base metals into gold and produce an elixir of life that granted eternal youth.

It's important to note that while this concept is thrilling in the world of fiction, such as J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, there's no evidence supporting the existence or functionality of such a stone in our real-world scientific understanding. Alchemy, although it laid some groundwork for modern chemistry, primarily served as a philosophical discipline in its time, with many of its goals being more symbolic than practical.
4 True ['Leontyne Price'] The American woman singer you're referring to is Leontyne Price. Her 1961 album, often called the "Blue Album," is formally titled "Arias from Operas by Verdi, Puccini, and Others." This album is highly regarded in opera circles and is part of Price's extensive and influential discography.
5 True ['Space Station'] Commander John Sheridan and the other main characters on "Babylon 5" did not live in what could be described as a "TV place." They lived on a space station, specifically Babylon 5, which is located in neutral space and serves as a hub for diplomacy and trade between various alien races.

The main characters, including Sheridan, have their own quarters on the station where they live and sleep. These quarters are small, cramped, and utilitarian, reflecting the fact that space on a space station is at a premium. They are not particularly glamorous or exciting, but they serve their purpose as a place for the characters to rest and recharge between their duties on the station.

It's worth noting that "Babylon 5" is a science fiction television series, and as such, the setting and living arrangements of the characters are fictional and not based on real-world locations or accommodations.
6 True ['Tyler'] The running mate of President William Henry Harrison who also fought in the War of 1812 was John Tyler. Harrison and Tyler were elected in 1840, but Harrison died just one month into his term. Tyler, who had been Vice President for only 32 days, assumed the presidency and went on to serve a full term.

During the War of 1812, Harrison served as a military officer and played a key role in the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, which helped to propel him to national prominence. Tyler, who was several years younger than Harrison, served in the Virginia militia during the war and saw action in the Chesapeake Bay area.

It's worth noting that Harrison and Tyler were from different political parties, with Harrison a member of the Whig Party and Tyler a Democrat. This political difference would eventually lead to tensions between the two men during Tyler's presidency.
7 True ['Elvis Costello'] I'm glad to hear you're interested in musical collaborations! The musician you're referring to is Elvis Costello, a highly influential and acclaimed British singer-songwriter. Costello and Burt Bacharach, the renowned American composer and singer, worked together on the album 'Painted from Memory,' which was released in 1998. This collaboration showcased the blending of their unique musical styles and earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.
8 True ['Corinth'] The isthmus in question is the Isthmus of Corinth. It is a narrow strip of land that connects the Peloponnese, a large peninsula in southern Greece, to the rest of the Greek mainland. The name "Corinth" is derived from the ancient and modern city of Corinth, which is located on this isthmus. This area has historical significance as it was once the site of the ancient city-state of Corinth, which was a major power in ancient Greece. Today, the Isthmus of Corinth is an important transportation hub, with a canal that allows ships to travel between the Aegean and Ionian seas without having to navigate around the Peloponnese.
9 True ['The Woman in White'] The Lady in White, or more famously known as "The Woman in White", is a novel by Wilkie Collins where the character Anne Catherick is often described as favoring the color white. This color becomes a significant symbol throughout the novel, representing innocence and mystery.
10 True ['Eucalyptus'] Eucalyptus Oil is the strong-smelling tree oil in Vicks VapoRub. This topical ointment is popular for relieving symptoms of cough and cold, such as nasal congestion. The main therapeutic ingredients include menthol, camphor, and eucalyptus oil, which all have cooling and decongestant properties. It's important to note that Vicks VapoRub should not be applied to the face of children under 2 years old due to the risk of respiratory distress.
11 False ['Run Interference'] The idiom you're referring to is "clear the way" or "open the way," which is derived from the idea of football players making a path for their teammate to run through by removing opposing players. This phrase means to remove obstacles or make it easier for someone to proceed or succeed.
12 True ['Virginia Woolf'] Virginia Woolf's story "Kew Gardens" was illustrated by her sister Vanessa Bell, who was indeed a member of the Bloomsbury Group. The story was published in 1919, and the illustrations by Vanessa Bell added a unique visual dimension to the written work. The collaboration between the two sisters is a testament to the creative synergy within the Bloomsbury Group, a group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell, who lived in Bloomsbury and were prominent in the first half of the 20th century.
13 True ['Fait Accompli'] Fait accompli. This English phrase, which translates to "concluded fact" in French, is used to describe a situation that has already happened or been decided before those affected by it are informed about it, making change difficult or impossible.
14 True ['Arsenic'] Salvarsan, also known as Arsphenamine, is an arsenic-based compound. It was the first effective treatment for syphilis, an infectious disease that if left untreated, can lead to serious complications over time. The use of salvarsan, however, was not without risk as arsenic is a toxic element. It required careful administration and monitoring by medical professionals. The introduction of penicillin in the mid-20th century largely replaced the use of salvarsan due to its superior effectiveness and lower toxicity.
15 True ['Jon Batiste'] Jon Batiste, a New Orleans-born pianist and musician, achieved a milestone in 2021 by winning an Oscar. He took home the award for Best Original Score for his work on the animated film "Soul." In addition to his Oscar win, Batiste released a new album titled "We Are." Despite these accomplishments, he continues to serve as the bandleader for "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." This highlights Batiste's versatility as a musician, spanning across various genres and platforms, while maintaining a prominent presence in the television industry.
16 True ['Customs'] Upon returning to Earth, the Apollo 11 astronauts declared the Moon rocks to the U.S. Customs Service. This might seem like a peculiar formality, but it was taken seriously as per the legal protocol. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, to which the United States is a signatory, stipulates that all celestial bodies and their resources are the common heritage of mankind. Therefore, the Moon rocks were technically "imported" and had to be declared.
17 True ['O. Henry'] The author of "The Gift of the Magi", O. Henry, did indeed serve time in prison. However, it was in 1897, not 1898, and the crime was embezzlement from a bank where he worked as a teller, not a fund embezzlement. This life experience likely influenced his writings, including the famous short story "The Gift of the Magi", which explores themes of love, sacrifice, and irony.
18 True ['Byzantine'] Ah, you're referring to the Byzantine era, a period of remarkable artistic development in the Eastern Roman Empire. The art form you're mentioning is mosaic, which indeed was very popular during this time. It's fascinating how they used tiny pieces of glass or stone, called tesserae, to create intricate designs and scenes.

A classic example of such mosaics can be found in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. The interior is adorned with beautiful mosaics depicting various biblical stories, emperors, and empresses. You'll often see a cornucopia, an icon of abundance and prosperity, featured in these mosaics as well.

However, it's essential to note that while the Byzantine Empire spanned from 400 to 1400 AD, the golden age of mosaics was more concentrated between the 6th and 12th centuries. After the 12th century, the use of mosaics started to decline, giving way to other art forms. But isn't it wonderful to think about how these artists meticulously crafted these masterpieces, each piece contributing to a larger, more meaningful image?
19 True ['Ethiopia'] Aviator Hubert Julian, known for his daring skydives while playing the saxophone, is a significant figure in black history. However, there seems to be some confusion in your question. Hubert Julian did not fight for any African empire against Italy in the 1930s. He was associated with Ethiopia and its emperor, Haile Selassie, but his involvement was more about providing aircraft and attempting to train the Ethiopian Air Force than directly participating in any fighting against Italy during that time period. The Second Italo-Ethiopian War, where Italy invaded Ethiopia, took place from 1935 to 1936. Julian's contributions were more in the realm of aviation and logistics than combat.
20 True ['Absolution'] Absolution is the term you're looking for. It's a quadrisyllabic word that represents the act of being absolved from sins, which is often associated with the sacrament of penance in various Christian denominations. This sacrament, also known as reconciliation, involves confessing one's sins to a priest and receiving penance as a form of reconciliation with God and the Church.
21 True ['Punjab'] Lahore is the capital city of the Punjab province in Pakistan. This province is significant as it is the most populous province in the country and shares its border with India. Lahore is a major cultural, historical, and economic center in Pakistan, known for its rich Mughal architecture, beautiful gardens, and delicious food. The city has a long history, with evidence of human habitation dating back over 2,000 years, and it has served as the capital of various empires and dynasties throughout the centuries. Today, Lahore is a bustling, vibrant city that is home to millions of people and a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to Pakistan.
22 False ['Sohpie Dahl'] The person you're referring to is Mamie Gummer. She is an actress and model, and yes, she is the granddaughter of the legendary actress Patricia Neal. Gummer has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry, appearing in various films, television shows, and on stage. She has also ventured into writing. It's always fascinating to see how talent can be passed down through generations in the world of entertainment!
23 True ['The Goldfinch'] The novel "The Goldfinch" by Donna Tartt features a boy, Theo Decker, who steals a painting of a bird, "The Goldfinch," after a museum bombing. The book was adapted into a film in 2019. In the story, Theo's theft of the painting serves as a significant plot point and symbol, affecting his life in various ways. The painting itself is an actual work by the Dutch artist Carel Fabritius, painted in 1654.
24 True ['Daniel Defoe'] The novel "Moll Flanders" was written by Daniel Defoe in 1722. Contrary to popular belief, Moll Flanders is not a real person but a fictional character. The novel is a first-person narrative of the life of Moll, who is born in Newgate Prison and lives an amoral life, committing crimes such as infanticide and bigamy. She does indeed climb a 'ladder' of sorts, in the sense of socio-economic mobility, through her cunning and deceitful ways, but her life is also marked by frequent poverty, suffering, and eventual redemption.
25 False ['Extant'] The answer you're looking for is "Excalibur." Excalibur is the legendary sword of King Arthur, which does not physically exist but is a prominent artifact in Arthurian legend. The misconception that it has physically existed over the centuries might have led to your question.
26 True ['Desperado'] Desperado (1995) is the middle film in Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi trilogy, which shares its title with an Eagles hit song. This film is a sequel to the low-budget 1992 film "El Mariachi" and follows the story of a mariachi seeking revenge against a cartel lord who has wronged him. The final film in the trilogy is "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" (2003). The Eagles song "Desperado" is from their 1973 album of the same name.
27 False ['Siamang'] The apes you're referring to are likely the "Orangutans," which inhabit the tropical rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia. They are not as obscure as some other primates, but they are not as well-known as gorillas or chimpanzees. Orangutans are highly intelligent and exhibit advanced tool use, cultural behaviors, and complex social structures. They are currently critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.
28 False ['Abide With Me'] In a hymn or spiritual, when including phrases such as "fast falls the eventide" and "in life, in death, O Lord," the implied request is for comfort and guidance. These phrases are often used to express a longing for divine protection and support during times of change or hardship, including the approach of night (symbolizing the end of life) and the permanence of one's existence (both in life and in death). By invoking these themes, the speaker is essentially asking for guidance, solace, and a sense of connection to a higher power.
29 True ['Tito'] Tito, the leader of Yugoslavia, is the correct answer. Josip Broz Tito was a 20th-century leader who was widely known by just his first name. He served as the leader of Yugoslavia from the end of World War II until his death in 1980, a period of over 35 years. During his tenure, Tito helped to build and maintain a unique form of socialism in Yugoslavia that was distinct from the Soviet model. He also played a key role in the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of countries that sought to remain neutral in the Cold War.

Tito died in 1980, and the Yugoslav nation began to unravel in the years that followed. The country eventually broke apart into several smaller nations in the 1990s, in a series of conflicts that became known as the Yugoslav Wars. Tito did not live to see the collapse of the Yugoslav nation that he had helped to build.
30 True ['Don Carlos', 'Don Carlo'] The Verdi opera where the title character is the son of the King of Spain is "Don Carlo." It is an Italian-language opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The story is based on the historical events of the Spanish Inquisition, the Dutch Revolt, and the Flemish people's fight for independence from Spanish rule in the 16th century. The title character, Don Carlo, is the Infante of Spain, who falls in love with Elizabeth of Valois, who was promised to his father, King Philip II, as part of a peace treaty.
31 True ['Humboldt'] The cool season in the Galapagos, known as the Garua season, is influenced by the Humboldt Current. This current is named after Alexander von Humboldt, a German naturalist and explorer. The Humboldt Current brings cold water from the Antarctic, causing increased mist and fog (the "Garua") and cooler temperatures in the Galapagos.
32 True ['Alphabet City'] Ah, the vibrant and bohemian spirit of Manhattan's East Village! The neighborhood you're referring to, which runs through Avenues A, B, C, and D, is known as Alphabet City. It has indeed been a haven for many artists, drawn to its eclectic mix of cultures, offbeat charm, and affordable rents.

In the past, this area was associated with the Beat Generation of writers and poets in the 1950s and '60s. Later, it became a hotbed for punk rock musicians and artists in the '70s and '80s. The neighborhood's rich history of artistic inhabitants has contributed to its enduring allure.

Some notable artists who have called Alphabet City home include Jean-Michel Basquiat, a renowned Neo-Expressionist painter; Keith Haring, an iconic figure in the New York City art scene; and even Madonna, who lived here during her early days as a struggling artist before achieving global stardom.

So, whether you're wandering down Tompkins Square Park or exploring the numerous galleries and performance spaces, Alphabet City remains a vibrant testament to the creative spirit that has long defined Manhattan's East Village.
33 False ['The Special Branch'] Sydney Reilly, also known as the "Ace of Spies," worked as an operative for the British Secret Service. More specifically, he was associated with the organization's covert operations unit, which was known as the "Special Section" or "Special Branch" of the Secret Service Bureau, the predecessor of the modern Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), also known as MI6. This department's name indeed contains the word 'Special,' and it is responsible for national security and foreign intelligence gathering.
34 True ['Nader'] The tally you are referring to is the result of a popular vote count that was not officially certified and included various third-party candidates, not just "what man." The final official tally in Florida for the 2000 presidential election was:

George W. Bush: 2,912,790
Al Gore: 2,912,253
Ralph Nader (Green Party): 97,488
Pat Buchanan (Reform Party): 17,484
Howard Phillips (Constitution Party): 14,899
Other candidates: 1,850

It's important to note that the official certified results from the Florida Secretary of State showed George W. Bush winning the state by 537 votes, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court in the controversial case of Bush v. Gore.
35 True ['Jill Scott'] The "The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency" series features Jill Scott as Precious Ramotswe, the owner and detective at the only female-run detective agency in Botswana. However, Scott is a platinum-selling singer-songwriter, not a Golden singer, known for her roles in films like Why Did I Get Married? and its sequel. The series, which has been adapted into a TV show, is based on the best-selling books by Alexander McCall Smith.
36 True ['Constantine'] The event you're referring to is often called the "Vision of Constantine" or "In Hoc Signo Vinces" (By this sign, you will conquer). This vision was said to have occurred in 312 A.D. before the Battle of Milvian Bridge, where Constantine the Great, who later became the first Christian Roman Emperor, claimed to have seen a cross of light in the sky, along with the Greek words "ἐν τούτῳ νίκα" (en touto nika), which can be translated to "By this, you will conquer" or "In this, conquer". This vision is often interpreted as a divine message leading to Constantine's conversion to Christianity.

It is important to note that this event is based on historical accounts, primarily from Christian sources, and its interpretation and significance have been subjects of debate among historians.
37 True ['Ardern'] Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, announced her resignation on January 19, 2023. She stated that she will step down no later than February 7, 2023, and will not be seeking re-election. Ardern has been the Prime Minister of New Zealand since October 26, 2017, and she was 37 years old when she took office, making her one of the youngest female heads of government in history. She has gained international recognition for her leadership, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Christchurch mosque shootings. Ardern is 42 years old as of 2023.
38 True ['Fossa'] In the "Madagascar" animated movie series, the character of Alex the lion is depicted as being friends with lemurs. This portrayal, however, is a dramatic license as in reality, lions are powerful carnivores and would consider lemurs as potential prey. Lemurs are small primates native to the island of Madagascar. In the wild, lemurs have to be wary of predators including fossas, various birds of prey, and snakes. Lions do not naturally inhabit Madagascar, so they do not pose a threat to lemurs in their native habitat.
39 False ['Ensconced'] The word you're looking for is "fixture." In the context of your question, a light fixture is a permanent installation, meaning it is settled and not going anywhere. A fixture is a piece of equipment or decoration that is firmly attached to something such as a building.
40 False ['The Power of the Dog'] I must clarify that Anthrax, a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive bacteria Bacillus anthracis, has never been used as a weapon against any individual, including Benedict Cumberbatch, in any 2021 western or any other film. This is purely fictional and would not be ethical or feasible in real life. Please let me know if you have any other non-fictional questions!
41 True ['The Turn of the Screw'] The Turn of the Screw is the Henry James novella that served as the basis for Benjamin Britten's opera "The Turn of the Screw". In this chilling ghost story, Peter Quint is a former valet of the house who, after his death, haunts Flora and Miles, the children residing in the estate, causing fear and chaos. The opera, like the novella, explores themes of innocence, corruption, and the supernatural.
42 True ['Night Vale'] I believe you are referring to the "Dear Internet" episode of the "Welcome to Night Vale" podcast. In this episode, Wil Wheaton does indeed play the role of a chef, but the name of the restaurant is "The Tourniquet," not "Tourniquet at the Intersection of Coast and Pine." The episode was released on October 26, 2015, as part of the show's second season. However, the episode does not focus on strange things happening at the restaurant. Instead, it is a regular episode of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast, which features a community radio show set in the fictional desert town of Night Vale, where strange and mysterious events occur regularly.
43 True ['Chisholm'] Shirley Chisholm was the woman who sought the Democratic nomination in 1972 and won 152 delegates before withdrawing from the race. She was a trailblazing politician, being the first African American woman elected to the United States Congress, serving as the representative for New York's 12th congressional district from 1969 to 1983. Chisholm's campaign for the presidency was historic, as she was the first African American candidate to seek a major party's nomination and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. Despite her eventual withdrawal, her campaign laid the groundwork for future female and minority candidates.
44 False ['Jacobs Ladder'] The biblical name that is commonly used to describe the high-voltage traveling arc that is maintained by ionized air is "Zipporah's Curtain." This term is derived from the story of Zipporah, the wife of Moses, who performed a circumcision ceremony on one of their sons using a sharp stone, creating sparks that were compared to an electric arc.

In electrical engineering, a traveling arc is a type of electrical discharge that occurs between two electrodes in a high-voltage electrical system. The arc is maintained by the ionization of the air, which creates a conductive path for the electrical current to flow. This phenomenon is commonly observed in electrical equipment such as transformers, switchgears, and circuit breakers.

While "Zipporah's Curtain" is a colorful and memorable term, it is not widely used in technical or academic contexts. Instead, electrical engineers and technicians typically use more precise terminology to describe the various types of electrical arcs and discharges that can occur in high-voltage systems.
45 True ['The Metro'] The title of the poem is "In a Station of the Metro." Ezra Pound's original version of the poem, which is the one you've quoted, is often referred to as the "ideogrammic" version. The poem describes a moment in a subway station where Pound observes the faces of people passing by, comparing them to petals on a wet, black bough. The image captures the fleeting, transient nature of modern urban life.
46 True ["Harry's House"] The title of Harry Styles' third solo pop album is "Harry's House," and as such, its possessive form would be "Harry's." The album was released in May 2022 and includes hit singles like "As It Was" and "Late Night Talking." Harry Styles is an English singer, songwriter, and actor who gained fame as a member of the boy band One Direction.
47 False ['Eroica'] If we remove one letter from the word "Erotica," we get "Beethoven's Fourth" symphony, as it is often referred to in abbreviated form. The seventh, eighth, and ninth symphonies of Beethoven are also well-known, but his fourth symphony is not particularly associated with the idea of a sexy section of a bookstore.
48 True ['Yemen'] The correct title for the international movie is "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen." This 2011 film is a romantic drama directed by Lasse Hallström and based on the novel of the same name by Paul Torday. The story revolves around a fisheries expert named Fred Jones, played by Ewan McGregor, who is recruited by a consultant to the Yemeni Sheikh to introduce salmon fishing to the Yemeni desert. The film also stars Emily Blunt, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Amr Waked.
49 True ['Pillars of Hercules', 'Hercules'] The flag of Spain does indeed have elements that represent its historical kingdoms - the coat of arms contains symbols from the kingdoms of Castile, León, Aragon, and Navarre. However, the second part of your question seems to refer to the Pillars of Hercules, which are two promontories at the Strait of Gibraltar, one located in Spain and the other in Morocco. These pillars are not astride the Sea of Gibraltar (which is actually just another name for the westernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea), but are instead the ancient name for the rocks that form the Strait. So while the Pillars of Hercules are a significant historical and cultural symbol, they are not part of Spain's flag.
50 True ['Crohn'] The organization you're referring to is the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, which was known as the Ileitis and Colitis Foundation in 1967. The dance featuring Ella Fitzgerald was held to honor Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, who was one of the first doctors to identify and describe regional ileitis, now known as Crohn's disease. The foundation's name was later changed to the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation to honor Dr. Crohn and his contributions to the field of medicine.
51 True ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] In economics, a term that starts with "U" and refers to a period during which business is at a high point is "boom." However, your second question seems to be referring to "upcycling" or "creative reuse," which means to use existing goods or materials to create something of higher quality or value than the original. This concept is about sustainability and reducing waste, rather than being directly related to the economic cycle.
52 True ['Lisbon'] The assassination of King Carlos I and his son, Prince Luis Filipe, occurred in the capital city of Lisbon, Portugal, in 1908. This tragic event took place at the Terreiro do Paço square, near the royal palace, when the king and his family were returning from a vacation in Vila Viçosa. The assassination marked the end of the Portuguese monarchy, which was subsequently abolished in 1910, leading to the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic.
53 False ['Jubjub'] "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!" is the opening line of the poem "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll, from his novel "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" (1871). The Jabberwock is a creature of nonsense verse, a monstrous beast that the protagonist, the young boy, must face and slay.

The bird that repeats itself and is not found in any ornithological books you've encountered is likely the "Tumtum bird" from Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" (1871). The Tumtum bird is a fictional creature that Alice encounters in her journey through the looking-glass world. It is described as a bird that "lays eggs in other birds' nests" and "sings with its head on backwards." The name "Tumtum" is a playful invention, and the bird does not appear in any real ornithological books.
54 True ['Inigo Jones'] The architect you're referring to is Inigo Jones. He was indeed hailed as England's first great architect. He started working on the Queen's House in 1616, which is considered England's first classical building. This project was commissioned by Anne of Denmark, the queen of King James I. The Queen's House is a remarkable example of Palladian architecture, a style that Jones introduced to England.
55 True ['Revolutionary Road'] The novel that Richard Yates referred to is "Revolutionary Road," and his title's intended meaning is that the "revolutionary spirit" of 1776, which marked the beginning of American independence, had reached a dead end in the 1950s. The Wheelers, the central characters in the novel, are a couple who struggle to maintain their dreams and ambitions amidst the stifling conformity and social expectations of the suburban American Dream. The novel explores the disillusionment and disconnection that many people experienced during this time period, and how the revolutionary spirit of the past had lost its meaning and relevance in the modern world.
56 True ['medulla oblongata'] The lowest part of the brainstem is called the medulla oblongata. It is responsible for controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. It is continuous with the spinal cord and is located above the cervical vertebrae. The medulla oblongata plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and damage to this area of the brainstem can have serious consequences, including death.
57 True ['Kool Herc'] Hip-Hop's 50th birthday in 2023 can be traced back to the party held on August 11, 1973, in the Bronx, New York, which was DJed by Clive Campbell, also known as DJ Kool Herc. The name "Hercules" was adopted by Campbell, inspired by a mythical strongman, representing his powerful presence and influence over the crowd. This event is widely recognized as the birth of Hip-Hop culture.
58 False ['Cuspidor'] upscale dip pot, which could be a fancy dish or container to hold a dip or sauce. The word "Crisp Duo" can be rearranged to form "Upscale Dip." The word "spittingly" is used at the beginning to add some flair to the question, but it doesn't have any relevance to the answer.
59 False ['Giraffe'] The amble is a type of walk that is used by several animals, including the okapi. In an amble, the legs on the same side of the body move together, which is different from the typical gait of many other animals.

As for the relative that moves its legs on the same side at the same time, that would be a human. When a person walks, the legs on the same side move together, with the left leg and left arm moving forward at the same time, followed by the right leg and right arm. This is known as a reciprocal gait and is different from the gait of many other animals, which often involves moving the opposite legs together.
60 True ['Wesley'] The American university named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, is Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. It's not to be confused with Wesley College in Dover, Delaware or Western Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, which are also named after him. However, it is important to note that Wesleyan University was not founded by Wesley himself, but by other Methodists who wanted to honor him.
61 True ['Perdition'] Tom Hanks starred in a film called "The Road to Perdition," which might be the film you're referring to. However, it's not about Tom Hanks' character experiencing spiritual loss or ruin. The film is a crime drama set during the Great Depression about a mob enforcer who goes on the run with his son after a hit is ordered on his family. The title "The Road to Perdition" is metaphorical, referring to the path towards destruction or ruin, but it's not about spiritual loss in a religious sense.
62 True ['Muir'] John Muir is known for his conservation efforts and advocacy of National Parks. However, the national monument in Marin County known for old growth redwoods, Muir Woods National Monument, is not named directly after him but is named in his honor. It's a common misconception to think the monument was specifically named after him like a surname, but it was actually named to pay tribute to his significant contributions to conservation.
63 True ['Jack Aubrey'] The hero of Patrick O'Brian's books who was portrayed by Russell Crowe in the movies is Jack Aubrey, the main character in the Aubrey-Maturin series.

The Svalbard Seed Vault is an important insurance policy for the world's food supply, as it provides a backup collection of seeds that can be used to restore crops in the event of a major disaster or catastrophe. The vault currently houses more than 1 million seed samples from around the world, representing a diverse range of plant species and varieties. It is operated by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, a nonprofit organization that works to conserve and promote the use of crop diversity.

The Templars were accused of a variety of offenses, including idolatry, sodomy, and the denial of Christ. Many of the knights confessed to these charges under torture, and in 1310, a number of them were burned at the stake in Paris.

The Templars' leaders, including their Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, were also condemned and executed. The order was officially dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312, and its assets were seized by the French crown.

The trial and suppression of the Knights Templar has been the subject of much debate and speculation over the centuries, with some historians arguing that the charges against the order were largely fabricated and motivated by political and financial considerations.

Each brother has a unique perspective, which is revealed through the novel's non-linear narrative. Faulkner's work often explores the deepest aspects of human existence, and "The Sound and the Fury" is no exception, as it delves into themes of time, memory, morality, and the decay of the American South.

This group consists of aquatic mammals adapted to life in the water, characterized by their streamlined bodies, limbs modified into flippers, and nostrils that can be closed. They are carnivorous and feed on fish and invertebrates. Despite their aquatic adaptations, pinnipeds still rely on land for important life activities such as breeding, molting, and resting.
74 True ['Narita'] The express train that connects Tokyo to Narita International Airport is the Narita Express (N'EX). This train is a fast and convenient way to travel between Tokyo and the airport, with frequent departures and a journey time of around 1 hour from Tokyo Station to Narita Airport.

77 True ['Olympus'] The largest volcano in the solar system is Olympus Mons, located on Mars. However, even if you are a fitfluencer or in top physical condition, you cannot just head to Mars and climb Olympus Mons. Currently, humans have not set foot on Mars, and the technology to do so is still in the development stage. Furthermore, Olympus Mons is over three times the height of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, and its slope is much gentler. Climbing it would be an enormous challenge even with advanced equipment and preparation.
78 True ['Groundlings'] The groundlings, or "stinkards," who paid the lowest amount to watch a play at the Globe Theatre in Shakespeare's time, were part of a lively and interactive audience that stood in the pit area directly in front of the stage. This area, also known as the "yard" or "theater pit," held the cheapest standing-room-only tickets, offering an up-close and personal experience with the actors, albeit without the comfort of a seat.
79 False ['Austria'] The design you're referring to is actually used on the 2 Euro coin, not the 1 Euro coin.

The obverse side of the 1 Euro coin typically features a design specific to the issuing country.
80 True ['November Rain'] Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses did not assure us that 'Nothing Lasts Forever, Even' during a weather report, as there is no record of him making such a statement in a meteorological context.

85 True ['Quiet Desperation'] Quiet desperation is the famous phrase from Henry David Thoreau's 'Walden'. He wrote, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

Thoreau's own experiment at Walden Pond was an attempt to escape this perceived malaise and live a more deliberate, authentic life.
86 True ['Marlow'] The character you're referring to is Charles Marlow from Joseph Conrad's novel "Heart of Darkness." In the story, Marlow is a steamboat captain who travels up the Congo River in Africa, where he encounters the ivory trader Kurtz, who has become deeply connected to the brutality and savagery of the region. Kurtz utters the famous line "The horror! The horror!" near the end of the novel, reflecting his disillusionment with the cruelty and greed he has witnessed. Marlow's experiences in the Congo lead him to question the morality and enlightenment of Western civilization.
87 True ['Gallium'] Gallium, with the symbol Ga, is a soft metal that is known for its low melting point, which is around 29.77 degrees Celsius (85.6 degrees Fahrenheit). While gallium's unique properties have been utilized in various applications, including electronics and medical devices, it does not have the ability to shape-shift or transform like the T-1000 character in the Terminator series. The T-1000's shape-shifting capabilities are a fictional concept and not a reality in real-world robotics or materials science.
88 True ['Fancy Free'] The ballet you're referring to is "Fancy Free," and it was indeed choreographed by Jerome Robbins. This groundbreaking work is significant as it was Robbins' first ballet and marked the beginning of his successful career in dance.

91 True ['Avogadro'] The Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro you're referring to proposed the hypothesis that equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. This hypothesis, which later became known as Avogadro's Law, was published in 1811.

Avogadro's Law is a significant gas law that allows us to relate the volume of a gas to the number of moles of gas particles it contains. The number of molecules in a mole of any substance is known as Avogadro's Number, which is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 molecules per mole. This fundamental constant is named after Amedeo Avogadro in recognition of his contribution to our understanding of the behavior of gases.
92 True ['Tequila'] The Champs' 1958 hit "Tequila" is an iconic instrumental tune featuring a heavy sax riff. While the title might make you think of alcohol, there are actually no lyrics in the song except for the word "tequila." It became a massive hit and a classic example of instrumental rock and roll. The song's infectious rhythm and catchy melody have made it endure as a popular tune even today.
93 True ['August Strindberg'] August Strindberg, a renowned Swedish playwright, novelist, and short story writer, published "Married" in 1884.

This Himalayan giant, whose name means 'White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers', stands tall at 24,980 feet. However, climbing it has been forbidden since 2003 due to the religious beliefs and environmental concerns of the Bhutanese government.
96 True ['Moravia'] The correct answer is Moravia. The preamble to the Constitution of the Czech Republic mentions the historical lands of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. These regions form the present-day Czech Republic.
97 True ['Ampere', 'Ampère'] There seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. The base unit of electrical current in the International System of Units (SI) is the ampere, which is named after André-Marie Ampère, a French physicist and mathematician who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetism. Therefore, the correct initials should be A.M.A., not A.M.P.
98 True ['Sphynx'] The Canadian Sphynx breed of cat traces its origins back to 1966 in Ontario, Canada, when a domestic cat gave birth to a hairless kitten named Prune. This chance mutation marked the beginning of the Sphynx breed, which has since been developed through selective breeding to produce cats that are notably hairless, with distinctive wrinkled skin and large, expressive eyes. The breed is known for its friendly and outgoing personality, and its unusual appearance makes it a standout in the world of pedigreed cats.
99 True ['Vorpal Sword'] In Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland," Alice slays the Jabberwocky with the Vorpal Sword. This sword is a part of the Jabberwocky poem by Lewis Carroll, where it is described as "a blade that would make one shudder." In the movie, the sword is depicted as a legendary weapon that only the true Alice can draw from its scabbard. With it, she beheads the Jabberwocky, putting an end to the tyranny of the Red Queen. The exclamation "Callooh! Callay!" is a phrase from the same Jabberwocky poem, used to express joy or excitement.
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome is credited with the creation of the Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Bible. He started this work around 382 and completed it around 405. The term "Vulgate" comes from the Latin word "vulgata," which means "common" or "commonly used." It became the standard version of the Bible in the Western Church and has greatly influenced Western theology and literature. It is important to note that the middle 'g' in the word "Vulgate" is silent.
101 True ['Eisenhower'] The president who signed legislation increasing the minimum wage to $1 per hour was Harry S. Truman. This happened in 1950 through the Fair Labor Standards Amendment of 1949, but it's important to note that $1 in 1950 is equivalent to about $11 in 2022, adjusted for inflation.

However, the president who approved and opened the St. Lawrence Seaway was Dwight D. Eisenhower. The St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of locks, canals, and channels in Canada and the United States, was opened for navigation on April 25, 1959, during Eisenhower's presidency. So, the two actions were performed by different presidents.
102 True ['Bret Easton Ellis'] The novel 'Less than Zero' is written by Bret Easton Ellis, providing a bleak depiction of disaffected, privileged young people in 1990s Los Angeles. The book is known for its explicit depictions of drug use, misogyny, and apathy. It is often considered a seminal work of 1980s and 1990s literature, and it brought Ellis to prominence as a young author.

104 True ['Florence Pugh'] Contrary to any rumors, Toby Sebastian, the British actor known for his role in "Game of Thrones," is not related to Florence Pugh, the actress who starred in "Don't Worry Darling." The two are not siblings in real life. Any speculation about their relationship is likely due to their shared experience in the film industry.
105 False ['Ha Ha'] It seems like you're looking for a humorous name for a sunken fence that separates animal territory from human territory, similar to the infamous "Serpentine Wall" at Monticello, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson to keep livestock out of his garden.

How about "The Bovine Barricade," "The Critter Containment," "The Furry Firewall," or "The Beastly Border"? These names are sure to bring a chuckle while also serving the purpose of distinguishing between animal and human territories.
106 True ['Venerate'] The word you're looking for is "Venerate." Derived from the Latin "venerari," it means to regard with deep respect or reverence. This term is often used in religious contexts, but it can also apply to any object, person, or principle that inspires such a feeling of devotion.

Flagella are whip-like structures that extend from the surface of many bacteria and are used for locomotion. They are typically longer than cilia, which are shorter, hair-like structures that are also present on some cells and are involved in movement. Flagella are composed of a protein called flagellin and are rotated by a motor protein, which is powered by the flow of protons across the bacterial cell membrane. The rotation of the flagellum propels the bacterium through its environment.

110 True ['Io'] Io, one of Jupiter's moons, was captured in a stunning infrared image by the Juno spacecraft in 2022. The image displayed the heat signatures of eight volcanoes on the surface of Io, the most volcanically active object in the solar system. This flyby was particularly notable as it was the first time Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral (JIA) instrument had observed Io's volcanic activity from such a close distance.
111 True ['NewsRadio'] Newsradio, a popular 1990s sitcom, featured Phil Hartman's distinctive and soothing voice for the character Bill McNeal. This Emmy-nominated series revolved around the staff of an New York City radio station, WNYX, and aired from 1995 to 1999.

113 True ['Pascal'] The French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical calculator, Pascaline, in 1642. Although simple in design, it could add and subtract two numbers directly and perform basic multiplication and division through repeated additions or subtractions. This ingenious device laid the foundation for the development of more complex calculating machines in the future. Pascal created the machine to help his father, a tax collector, with his calculations, demonstrating the practical applications of technology even in its earliest forms.
114 True ['Colleen Hoover'] The woman author who recently took the top two spots on the paperback trade fiction list is Colleen Hoover.

Hoover is a prolific and highly acclaimed author in the contemporary romance genre.
115 True ['Rhode Island'] Hammersmith Farms is located in Newport, Rhode Island, but Jackie and JFK were married at St. Mary's Church in Washington D.C., not in Rhode Island. So, neither the church nor the farm is in the state of Rhode Island.
116 True ['Stalingrad'] Stalingrad, now known as Volgograd, was the city where the Nazis' advance into Russia was halted and two of their armies surrendered on February 2, 1943. This victory marked a turning point in World War II, as the German forces suffered a massive defeat that significantly weakened their military capabilities on the Eastern Front.
117 True ['Karma Chameleon'] The song you're referring to is "Karma Chameleon" by Boy George and Culture Club, which was a massive hit in the 1980s.

However, over time, its meaning has expanded to include any highly biased or exaggerated account that idealizes its subject.
119 True ['Potsdam'] The city of Potsdam, Germany, once a residence for the Elector of Brandenburg, was later chosen as the site for the Potsdam Conference in 1945 towards the end of World War II.

120 True ['Francis Bacon'] The 17th century essayist and Lord Chancellor of England with the same name as the 20th century painter is Francis Bacon. However, it's important to note that the Francis Bacon you're referring to, the painter, is actually Francis Bacon Esq, who was named after the earlier Francis Bacon, the philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, orator, and author. So, the two Francis Bacons are not the same person, but share a name.
121 True ['Calypso'] The nymph you're referring to is Calypso. She is a figure in Homer's "Odyssey," and she detains Odysseus for several years on her island, Ogygia. The famous 18th-century painter Angelica Kauffmann depicted this scene in her work, highlighting the welcoming nature of Calypso towards Odysseus.

Calypso's name does not share a direct connection with a music style named Angelica Kauffmann. However, Angelica Kauffmann was a significant figure in the development of the Neoclassical style of painting, which was influenced by the music style of the Classical period.

Therefore, while Calypso and Angelica Kauffmann are connected through the painting, there is no direct relationship between Calypso and a music style named after Angelica Kauffmann.
122 True ['The Thing'] The movie you're referring to is "The Thing." This 1982 science fiction horror film is directed by John Carpenter and set in Antarctica. Kurt Russell plays the role of R.J.

123 False ['Sir James Dewar'] The comic verse you're referring to is a humorous tribute to the British scientist Michael Faraday, who lived in the 19th century. Faraday was renowned for his work in chemistry and physics, particularly in the field of electromagnetism. The verse is playing on his name, replacing "Faraday" with "Sir James" and highlighting his extraordinary ability to liquefy gases, which was indeed one of his significant achievements. The verse is meant to be a lighthearted way of acknowledging Faraday's scientific prowess and his contributions to the field of science.
124 True ['Cold Open'] 'Cold Open' is the term you're looking for. It refers to a scene that takes place before the title sequence of a television show, and it's a staple of "Saturday Night Live." These segments are typically topical, often involving political satire or commentary on current events, and they can vary in length. The term "cold open" comes from the fact that this segment opens the show "cold," or immediately, without any commercial break or introductory material.
125 True ['Tom Jones'] The event you're referring to took place on the British talent show "The Voice UK" in 2017. The Welsh legend who spontaneously duetted with Jennifer Hudson on the song "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" is Tom Jones. Jones, a well-known singer and coach on the show, was moved by Hudson's performance and joined her on stage for an impromptu duet.
126 True ['Windward'] The waterway you're referring to is the Windward Passage. It is the strait located due northwest of the western end of Hispaniola (which includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and lies between that island and Cuba. To the southeast of Hispaniola are the Windward Islands, which are the southern, or southeastern, islands of the Lesser Antilles in the West Indies. The name "Windward" comes from the fact that these islands are exposed to the prevailing winds, which blow from the northeast to the southwest.
127 True ['Butler'] The female author who wrote "Kindred" is Octavia Butler. She was a prominent African-American science fiction author known for her incisive social commentary. In "Kindred", Butler explores themes of slavery, race, and gender through the unique narrative of Dana, a modern black woman who involuntarily time-travels between her home in 1970s California and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. This harrowing journey forces Dana to confront the brutal realities of slavery and its enduring impact on American society.
128 False ['peristaltic', 'peristalsis'] The movement or contractions that move food from the stomach into the small intestine are called the migrating motor complex (MMC). These contractions occur in a cyclical pattern in the stomach and small intestine when the stomach is empty, helping to clear out any remaining food particles and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.

During pregnancy, the hormone progesterone can cause the lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle that separates the esophagus from the stomach) to relax, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and causing heartburn. Progesterone can also slow down the MMC, which can cause food to stay in the stomach for a longer period of time and contribute to heartburn. However, it is important to note that the primary cause of heartburn during pregnancy is the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, rather than the slowing down of the MMC.
129 True ['The Unbearable Lightness of Being'] The novel where Tereza loves Tomas, who has a mistress named Sabina, is "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Milan Kundera. This book, published in 1984, is a profound and thought-provoking novel that explores the complexities of love, life, and relationships. Set in Prague during the Soviet occupation, it tells the story of Tomas, a successful surgeon and womanizer, and his wife Tereza, a sensitive and intelligent woman who struggles to cope with Tomas' infidelity.

131 True ['Luminosity'] Sun's Luminosity - The answer is an astronomical term, 'Sun's Luminosity', which is a measure of a star's total energy output over time. The anagram "Mutiny Oils" provides a clever hint to help uncover this celestial concept.
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] BRMC stands for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, a rock band that originated from San Francisco, California. The band's name is indeed inspired by Marlon Brando's biker gang in the 1953 film "The Wild One." Known for their fusion of various rock sub-genres, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has released numerous albums and gained a significant following since their formation in 1998.
133 False ['Yellen'] I'm unable to provide a certain answer because my knowledge is based on data up to 2021 and I cannot predict future events. However, I can tell you that so far, there have been two presidents in the United States since the Federal Reserve (FED) chair position was established, who were not economists: Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.

Ronald Reagan's successor was George H.W. Bush, who did not become FED chair. Donald Trump's successor will be the 47th President of the United States, who has not been determined yet.

Therefore, I cannot provide a suitable answer to your question.
134 True ['Auricle'] Auricles are the parts of the heart that resemble animals' ears, hence sharing a name. These are the left and right upper chambers of the heart, receiving blood from the veins and passing it to the ventricles. This misled many early anatomists, leading them to believe that the heart had a similar structure to that of a human hand, with the auricles acting as ears.
135 False ['Josef K'] The character you're referring to is Jay Gatsby's friend, Todd Andrews, from the novel "A Rumor of War" by Philip Caputo. In the book, Todd's life takes a turn for the worse on his 30th birthday when he is arrested for drunk driving, and his seemingly perfect life begins to unravel.

The reason this character's situation might be described as Kafka-esque is because of the sudden and inexplicable turn of events that lead to his downfall, as well as the sense of helplessness and alienation that Todd experiences as his life spirals out of control. These themes are reminiscent of the works of Franz Kafka, a Czech writer known for his surreal and nightmarish depictions of modern life.

However, it's important to note that while Todd's experiences may share some similarities with Kafka's style, "A Rumor of War" is not a Kafka novel. The term "Kafka-esque" is often used more broadly to describe any situation that is surreal, nightmarish, or oppressive in nature, regardless of whether it was actually written by Kafka himself.
136 True ['Animorphs'] The 1990's book series you're referring to is "Animorphs" by K.A. Applegate. In this series, a group of teenagers are given the ability to transform into any animal they touch, which they use to fight against an alien invasion. The shapeshifting aspect is a significant part of the story, as the characters must navigate the challenges and moral dilemmas that come with having such a powerful ability. The series was popular among young readers for its action, adventure, and thought-provoking themes.
137 True ['St. Lawrence Seaway'] Erie Canal / New York State Barge Canal (Its original name was the Erie Canal, but it's now part of the New York State Barge Canal system) is the navigation route that Welland Canal, a major part, connects to. This system connects Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and is a part of the much longer St. Lawrence Seaway which goes all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, covering a total distance of around 2,300 miles.
138 True ['Richard Powers'] The Overstory is a novel written by Richard Powers, and it does indeed feature the Pacific Northwest timber wars as a significant setting within the narrative. This Pulitzer Prize-winning book delves into the lives of various characters whose stories become intertwined, exploring their connections to trees and the natural world. The timber wars, which took place in the Pacific Northwest during the late 20th century, serve as a backdrop to illustrate the conflicts between industrial logging companies, environmental activists, and government agencies.
139 True ['midships'] The word you're looking for is "midships." It refers to the central part of a ship, running lengthwise. While there isn't a common plural form of "midships" because it's a non-count noun, in a more metaphorical sense, one could say "midshipses" or "midships areas" to refer to multiple centers of a ship or other similar places. However, these are not standard English and may sound strange to native speakers.
140 True ['Maximilian'] The diamond ring with the letter 'M' was given to Mary of Burgundy by Maximilian I, who was later elected as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. At the time of the gift, Maximilian was merely the Archduke of Austria and fiancé to Mary. This ring is historically significant as it symbolizes the beginning of their relationship, which ultimately united the Burgundian and Habsburg dynasties.
141 False ['Formosa'] 
142 True ["Li'l Abner"] The comic strip "Li'l Abner" was created by Al Capp and set in the hillbilly community of Dogpatch. The strip, which was popular from 1934 to 1977, presented a humorous and satirical take on American life and politics, with characters like the lazy but lovable Li'l Abner Yokum and his beautiful and strong-willed girlfriend, Daisy Mae. The strip was known for its exaggerated caricatures, slapstick humor, and clever wordplay. Despite its often absurd and comical tone, "Li'l Abner" also tackled serious social issues, such as poverty, corruption, and the dangers of unchecked capitalism.
143 True ['Uzbekistan'] The 'Stan' countries are Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Arranged alphabetically, Uzbekistan is the last. No other 'Stan' country comes after it in the list.
144 False ['Worsted'] The answer is "Wool." While it may sound like a negative term in some contexts, wool is a natural fabric sourced from sheep and other animals. It's highly valued for its durability, warmth, and resistance to water. It's often used in high-end clothing such as suits and pleated skirts.
145 True ['Boole'] The correct answer is George Boole. He was born in 1815 and made significant contributions to mathematics, particularly in the field of algebra, where he introduced what is now known as Boolean algebra. This system of algebraic logic forms the basis for computer programming and electronic devices. Although his work doesn't directly name "search" or "operators," its influence is fundamental to these areas.
146 True ['Siegfried'] Siegfried

Richard Wagner, the renowned German composer and dramatist, started writing a poem around 1850 that would become the basis for the "Ring" cycle, also known as "Der Ring des Nibelungen." The poem was initially titled "Siegfried's Tod" (Siegfried's Death), which was later changed to "Götterdämmerung" (Twilight of the Gods) as part of the complete tetralogy.

"The Death of Siegfried" focuses on the eponymous heroic character, Siegfried, who is a central figure in the "Ring" cycle. The story revolves around Siegfried's life, heroic deeds, tragic love, and eventual death, which sets the stage for the twilight of the gods and the end of the world as they know it.
147 False ['Tyrion Lannister'] The character who said this line, "We've had Vicious Kings and We've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot boy king?" is Tywin Lannister, spoken in the TV series Game of Thrones. This line is from the fifth season, second episode, when Tywin Lannister expresses his concerns about King Joffrey's successor, King Tommen Baratheon.
148 True ['Havel'] The play "Leaving" that you mentioned was written by Václav Havel, a Czech writer, philosopher, and former politician. He served as the last president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 until 1992 and then as the first president of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003. "Leaving" was his first play in over two decades, and it drew from his experiences as a politician and president. The play explores themes of power, morality, and the human condition, reflecting Havel's background as a dissident and his time in politics.
149 True ['Ghent'] The Treaty of Ghent, often mistakenly associated with a Belgian city, was actually signed in Ghent, then a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (and now modern-day Belgium). Signed on December 24, 1814, this treaty ended the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain. It is important to note that the treaty restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum, meaning there were no decisive gains for either side. This is an interesting example of how a treaty can end a war without either side achieving a clear victory.
150 True ['Parliament Hill'] The hill that you're referring to is called Parliament Hill, which is located in Ottawa, Canada. Parliament Hill is home to the Canadian Parliament Buildings, which are the seat of the Government of Canada.

There are indeed statues of John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson on Parliament Hill. Both Diefenbaker and Pearson were prominent Canadian politicians who served as Prime Minister of Canada. Diefenbaker was Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, while Pearson served as Prime Minister from 1963 to 1968.

The statue of John Diefenbaker is located on the east side of the Centre Block, the main building of the Parliament Buildings. The statue was unveiled in 1998, and it depicts Diefenbaker in a suit and holding a document in his hand.

The statue of Lester Pearson is located on the west side of the Centre Block, near the Peace Tower. The statue was unveiled in 1979, and it depicts Pearson in a suit and holding a map in his hand.

Other notable Canadians who are commemorated with statues on Parliament Hill include Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Robert Borden, and Sir John A. Macdonald.
151 True ['Electroconvulsive therapy'] ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy) is a type of brain stimulation therapy that is used to treat severe depression, treatment-resistant depression, and bipolar disorder. It involves the application of a small amount of electric current to the brain, which induces a brief seizure. This process can help to alleviate symptoms of depression and other mental health conditions, and it is typically used when other treatments have not been effective.

ECT is considered to be a safe and effective treatment for severe depression, and it has been in use for many decades. However, it is typically used as a last resort, after other treatments have been tried, due to the potential for side effects and the need for anesthesia during the procedure.

It's important to note that ECT is a medical treatment that should only be performed by trained and experienced professionals in a controlled medical setting. If you or someone you know is considering ECT, it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a qualified mental health provider.
152 True ['Dominican'] The Dominican Order, easily recognized by their white tunics and black cloaks, are sometimes referred to as the Black Friars. This nickname distinguishes them from other orders, such as the Franciscans, who are often called the Grey Friars due to their gray habits. The Dominicans, founded by Saint Dominic in the 13th century, are known for their commitment to learning and preaching.
153 False ['Will and Grace', 'Will & Grace'] "Frasier" is the TV sitcom that won a multitude of Emmys during its initial run from 1998 to 2006. The show, a spin-off of "Cheers," followed the life of Dr. Frasier Crane, a psychiatrist and radio show host, in Seattle. In 2020, a revival of the series was announced, and it went on to win a few more awards. However, the question seems to be a bit confused as it mentions the show ending in 2020 after the brief reboot, while in reality, the reboot was announced in 2020, but it has not ended yet.
154 True ['Axolotl'] The salamander you're referring to is the Axolotl, which is not only unique to Mexico but also critically endangered. This amphibian is a type of mole salamander, distinguished by its distinctive features such as external gills and a dorsal fin extending from behind its head to the tip of its tail.

The Axolotl's name is derived from the Nahuatl word 'axolotl', which means 'water monster' or 'water dog'. Intriguingly, this creature has the ability to regenerate its limbs, spinal cord, heart, and other organs, making it an object of fascination for scientists studying regeneration.

Unfortunately, due to habitat loss, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species, the Axolotl's natural habitat - the Xochimilco lake complex in Mexico City - has become severely degraded, leading to a significant decline in their population. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this fascinating and culturally significant creature.
155 False ['Sentience'] The prison term could be "five years". If you insert one letter "r", you get "sieve years". This doesn't make sense. However, if you rearrange the letters in "sieve years", you can form the phrase "consciousness seeks", which is the title of a book by Nicholas Humphrey. So the answer is "Consciousness Seeks: How the Mind Creates Its Own Reality".
156 True ['William Jennings Bryan'] The presidential campaign slogan "Let the people rule" was used by William Jennings Bryan during his 1900 campaign for the presidency of the United States. Bryan, a Democrat, was also the party's nominee in the 1896 and 1908 elections. He was a strong advocate for the common man and used this slogan to express his belief in giving more power to the people and less to the wealthy and powerful elite. However, he was not successful in his presidential bids, and the slogan did not help him secure the presidency.
157 False ['Knowledge is Power'] "Knowledge itself is power" is the phrase derived from Francis Bacon's Latin quote "Ipsa Scientia Potestas Est". This statement highlights the significance and empowerment that knowledge brings to individuals.
158 True ['Suva'] The capital of Fiji is Suva and it is home to the University of the South Pacific. It's a significant city in the Pacific region, serving as a hub for commerce, politics, and education. Suva is known for its cultural diversity, vibrant atmosphere, and beautiful natural surroundings. The University of the South Pacific, located in Suva, is an important institution that serves many countries in the Pacific, offering a wide range of programs and opportunities for students from the region and around the world.
159 True ['Monsanto'] The company that first made Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, is Monsanto. In 1970, Monsanto chemist John E. Franz discovered glyphosate's herbicidal properties. After its introduction in 1974, Roundup quickly gained popularity as an effective weed killer. In the 1990s, Monsanto began selling genetically modified (GM) crops, such as soybeans, cotton, and corn, which were engineered to be resistant to Roundup. This resistance allowed farmers to use the herbicide more freely, killing weeds without harming the crops. This has been a subject of controversy due to concerns about the environmental impact and health risks associated with the increased use of glyphosate.
160 True ['Rothaniel'] The 2022 stand-up special you're referring to is "Jerrod Carmichael: Rothaniel." In this special, Jerrod Carmichael does discuss personal secrets and experiences, but it is important to note that the title "Rothaniel" is not a reveal of a first name or a secret about the show itself. The origin and meaning of the name "Rothaniel" are not explicitly revealed in the special. It is most likely a stage name or a name with personal significance to Jerrod Carmichael.
161 True ['Kyushu'] Kyushu

Okinoshima is a sacred island located in the Genkai Sea off the coast of Munakata, Fukuoka Prefecture, in the northwest of Kyushu, one of Japan's four main islands. This island is considered sacred and has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 2017 as part of the "Sacred Islands of Japan" group, along with two other Munakata shrines on the mainland, namely the Tashibunomiya Shrine and the Nakatsushima Shrine. The island is known for its Shinto rituals and practices, and for many centuries, women were not allowed to set foot on the island.
162 True ['Rimsky-Korsakov'] The fifth member of "The Five" or "Mighty Handful," a group of Russian composers associated with nationalistic music, was Rimsky-Korsakov. The group was centered in St. Petersburg and its members aimed to create a distinctively Russian style of classical music, as opposed to the more European-oriented style of composers like Tchaikovsky in Moscow. The other members of The Five were Mily Balakirev, Aleksandr Borodin, Modest Mussorgsky, and César Cui.
163 True ['Ming'] The Ming Dynasty, known for its exquisite porcelain, did import cobalt blue pigment for use in its ceramics. However, it's crucial to note that this cobalt blue was not from Prussia but was primarily sourced from the Middle East via the Silk Road. The misconception might arise because Prussia is often associated with cobalt mining in the 19th century, but in the context of the Ming Dynasty, Prussia had no role in providing the pigment.
164 True ['Leguizamo'] The actor you're referring to is John Leguizamo. He is of Colombian descent and has had a successful career in film, television, and theater. In the late 1990s, he starred in movies such as "Summer of Sam" and "Spawn." More recently, he lent his voice to the character Bruno in the Disney animated film "Encanto." However, it's worth noting that Leguizamo has had a long and varied career, and it's always important to consider the full range of an artist's work when discussing their contributions to the entertainment industry.
165 True ['Thorazine', 'Chlorpromazine'] In the movie 'Shutter Island', which is set in 1954, the character Dr. John Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley, would not have been hoping for any specific anti-psychotic that the FDA approved that year, because there were no FDA approvals for anti-psychotics in 1954. The first anti-psychotic medication, Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), was approved by the FDA in 1955, and it revolutionized the treatment of mental illnesses.
166 False ['Jungian'] The concept of an "anima," a feminine inner personality, is central to Carl Gustav Jung's analytical psychology. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who lived from 1875 to 1961. He is often associated with his famous contemporaries Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, but his theories and ideas diverged significantly from theirs. Jung's concept of the anima is one of several archetypes that he believed existed in the collective unconscious, a term he used to describe structures of the unconscious mind shared among beings of the same species.
167 True ['Giorgione'] The painter you're referring to is Giorgione, also known as "Big George." He was a crucial figure in the Venetian school of the Italian Renaissance. Giorgione is renowned for his contributions to oil painting techniques, which allowed him to create atmospheric and evocative works of art. Some of his most famous pieces include "The Tempest" and "The Sleeping Venus." Despite his significant influence on other artists, like Titian, who completed some of Giorgione's unfinished works after his untimely death, much mystery still surrounds the life and oeuvre of this great master.
168 False ['Wisconsin'] I'm afraid there seems to be a misunderstanding. There is no "Samuel's cave" in LaCrosse County or any other county in any state in the United States. It's possible you're referring to the Lascaux Cave, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in France famous for its Paleolithic cave paintings. However, there's no vandalism issue at Lascaux currently that I'm aware of. If you have information about a specific situation, I'd be happy to try to provide a more accurate response.
169 True ['Highly Effective People'] "Highly Effective People" is the completion of Stephen R. Covey's title "The 7 habits of...". The third word, "now", does not accurately fit within the title. The book is about the habits that can help an individual become a highly effective person in both their personal and professional life.
170 True ['linear accelerator'] A linac, in the context of Menlo Park, CA, refers to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory located in Menlo Park, California. It was originally called the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) and was renamed to its current name in 2005.

The SLAC linac is a linear particle accelerator, which is a type of particle accelerator that uses a linear beam tube to accelerate charged particles to high speeds. In the case of SLAC, the linac is used to accelerate electrons to high energies for use in a variety of experiments aimed at understanding the nature of matter and energy.

The SLAC linac is 2 miles long and is one of the longest linear accelerators in the world. It was built in the 1960s and has been instrumental in the development of many important discoveries in physics, including the discovery of quarks and the development of X-ray lasers.
171 True ['Criminal Minds'] Mr. Scratch, also known as Peter Lewis, is a villain who first appeared in season 10 of the CBS series "Criminal Minds." He is a highly intelligent and manipulative serial killer who uses technology to terrorize his victims. Mr. Scratch is a recurring villain in the series and is known for his distinctive scarred face. He is a formidable adversary for the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) and is responsible for several high-profile crimes.
172 False ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] The English equivalent of the Italian saying "a caval donato non si guarda in bocca" is "never look a gift horse in the mouth." Both phrases mean that one should not be ungrateful or overly critical of a gift that has been received, as it is impolite and may show a lack of appreciation. The phrase "never look a gift horse in the mouth" comes from the practice of determining a horse's age by looking at its teeth. A person who examines a gift horse's teeth may be seen as ungrateful, as they are scrutinizing the gift instead of simply being thankful for it.
173 False ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 1926 Balfour Report introduced the concept of "Equal in status, in no way subordinate to each other" to describe the relationship between the United Kingdom and its Dominions, which included countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. This concept is often referred to as "Dominion status" or "autonomous communities" within the British Empire and Commonwealth.

The term "Dominion status" signified a significant step towards self-government for these countries, as they were granted greater autonomy and independence from the United Kingdom while still maintaining their allegiance to the British Crown. The Dominions were allowed to govern their own domestic and external affairs, and they had the right to secede from the British Empire if they so desired.

The Balfour Report played a crucial role in shaping the relationship between the United Kingdom and its Dominions, paving the way for a more equal and cooperative partnership between them. This new relationship was formalized in the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which gave legal recognition to the concept of Dominion status and further strengthened the autonomy of the Dominions within the British Commonwealth.
174 True ['William Blake'] The page from "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" is from the English artist, poet and printmaker William Blake. This book is a collection of texts and illustrations that express Blake's own idiosyncratic form of spirituality, which was heavily influenced by the Romantic movement and the ideals of the French and American Revolutions.

In "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," Blake presents a unique vision of the universe, in which energy, creativity, and passion (represented by Hell) are in conflict with restrictive rules and moral codes (represented by Heaven). The book is known for its striking visual style and its exploration of complex themes, such as the nature of good and evil, the role of the artist in society, and the relationship between the human experience and the divine.

Blake's work has had a lasting impact on literature, art, and philosophy, and continues to be studied and celebrated today for its originality, vision, and power.
175 True ['Han'] The world's largest bridge fountain, Seoul's Moonlight Rainbow, is located in South Korea and spans an impressive 3,740 feet. This magnificent water feature shoots water recycled from the Han River below. The fountain, which is beautifully lit up at night, not only adds to the city's skyline but also serves as a symbol of Seoul's technological prowess and commitment to sustainability. The Han River, which flows through the heart of Seoul, is a vital source of water for the city's residents and is also a popular destination for recreational activities.
176 True ['Finnish'] The words you've provided are Finnish, a language spoken in Finland. The word "tuli" does indeed mean "fire" in Finnish, while "tuuli" means "wind". Finnish is a unique language in that it utilizes double vowels and consonants quite frequently, which can be challenging to master for those not familiar with this Uralic language.
177 True ['Prometheus'] The answer to the riddle is Prometheus. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a titan who defied the gods by providing fire to mankind, leading to technological advancement. However, he was eventually punished by Zeus by being chained to a mountain (Caucasus), where an eagle ate his liver daily, only for it to regrow and be consumed again. This is why it was "lit" when Prometheus was with mankind, but it got "real dark" after Zeus cuffed him to the mountain.
178 True ['plethora'] The word you're looking for is "plethora". Derived from the Greek word "plethora" which means "fullness", this eight-letter term in English is used to describe an overabundance or excessive supply of something. It's a great word to use when you want to express that there is too much of something in a sophisticated manner.
179 True ['As you Like It'] The speech that contains the line, "My Brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit" is from the play "As You Like It" by William Shakespeare. The line is spoken by Rosalind in Act 1, Scene 2. In this speech, Rosalind is expressing her frustration with her brother Jaques, who has chosen to continue his education instead of returning home to take up his responsibilities as a member of their father's court.
180 True ['Oort'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but as of my last update, there has been no green comet visiting Earth in 2023. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an answer to your question. However, I can tell you that comets are sometimes associated with the Oort cloud, a theoretical spherical cloud of icy bodies surrounding the Sun at distances up to about 50,000 AU. It's named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who proposed its existence. If a new green comet does visit Earth in the future, I'll be sure to provide the most current and accurate information available.
181 True ['Croesus'] The character is referring to Croesus, the ancient Lydian king who was proverbial for his great wealth. The full quote is often given as "If I get a patent, I shall be as rich as Croesus." This line is from the 1696 play "The Committee" by John Tatham. The character who speaks this line is a playwright who believes that if he can secure a royal patent for his plays, he will become immensely wealthy, just like the legendary King Croesus.
182 True ['Germanicus'] The person you're referring to is Germanicus, who was a prominent Roman general and the brother of Claudius, as well as the father of Caligula. While he did campaign near the Rhine, his famous name does not come from that region. Instead, Germanicus was given his name because of his campaigns in Germania, where he achieved significant victories against Germanic tribes. His successful campaigns and leadership skills earned him great popularity among the Roman people.
183 True ['Parallax'] Parsecs are not named after any words combined with 'second'. It is actually a unit of distance used in astronomy, defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc. The name is derived from "parallax second", as it is based on the principle of parallax.
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] The correct answer to your riddle is "Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th takes on Mrs. Doubtfire," which is a reference to the crossover scene in the 1993 film "Freaked" where Jason Voorhees, the iconic slasher villain from the Friday the 13th series, faces off against Mrs. Doubtfire, the titular character played by Robin Williams in the 1993 film of the same name. In the scene, Mrs. Doubtfire uses a cake moisturizer as a weapon against Jason.
185 True ['Library Paste'] The old 'LP' that you're referring to is likely a play on words, where 'LP' stands for "Library Paste," which is a type of thick white adhesive commonly used in bookbinding. It's called "Library Paste" because it was traditionally used in libraries for various book repair and binding tasks.

Library Paste is a starch-based adhesive that is strong, flexible, and resistant to aging, making it an ideal choice for bookbinding. It can be used to attach spine linings, endpapers, and hinges in bookbinding projects. It's also useful for repairing tears and reinforcing weak spots in book pages.

Library Paste is typically made from a mixture of wheat starch and water, which is cooked and then cooled before use. It has a thick, creamy consistency and a neutral odor. It's easy to apply with a brush or a spatula, and it dries clear and flexible.

Overall, Library Paste is a versatile and reliable adhesive that has been a staple in the bookbinding and conservation field for many years.
186 True ['Rime of the Ancient Mariner'] The poem you're referring to is likely "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In this poem, there is indeed a notable 9-line stanza that mentions a steersman:

The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow followed free;
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea.

Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,
'Twas sad as sad could be;
And we did speak only to break
The silence of the sea!

All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.

Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.

Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor any drop to drink.

The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy sea.

About, about, in reel and rout
The death-fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.

And some in dreams assured were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so;
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.

And every tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root;
We could not speak, no more than if
We had been choked with soot.

Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!
Instead of the cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.

- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" (Part I)

This 9-line stanza describes the moment when the ship is stuck in the middle of the sea without any wind, and the crew is suffering from thirst. The albatross, which the mariner had killed earlier in the poem, is hung around his neck as a curse.
187 True ['Montserrat'] Ah, you're talking about the island of Montserrat in the West Indies. Christopher Columbus named it in 1493, and it was indeed under French rule for a brief period. However, the British have had control over this beautiful volcanic island since 1783. It's a fascinating place with an interesting history!
188 True ['The Commitments'] The Commitments, a novel by Roddy Doyle, introduced the world to an imaginary Irish band of the same name. The story revolves around a group of working-class Dubliners who come together to form a soul band. The novel was later adapted into a successful movie in 1991. The band's members include Jimmy Rabbitte, the band manager; Deco Cuffe, the lead singer; and numerous other musicians, each with their own unique personality and backstory. The Commitments are on a mission to bring soul music to the masses in Dublin, and the novel follows their journey, filled with humor, drama, and of course, plenty of music.
189 True ['101'] Carl Gauss was a German mathematician who is known for his many contributions to various fields of mathematics. According to the legend, when Gauss was a young student, his teacher assigned the class the task of adding up all the positive integers from 1 to 100 as a way to keep them busy. However, Gauss was able to find the sum almost immediately.

Gauss realized that he could pair up the numbers in such a way that each pair would sum to 101. For example, he could pair 1 with 100, 2 with 99, 3 with 98, and so on, until he reached the middle number, 50, which he could pair with itself. Since there are 50 pairs, and each pair sums to 101, the total sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100 is:

Sum = Number of pairs \* Sum of each pair
Sum = 50 \* 101
Sum = 5050

Therefore, the answer to the legend is that each pair of numbers sums to 101.
190 True ['Io'] Io, a priestess of Hera, was one of the lovers of Zeus who was turned into a cow. Zeus was attracted to Io and, fearing his wife Hera's wrath, transformed Io into a cow to conceal their affair. However, Hera soon discovered the deception and, as a punishment, placed a gadfly to torment the cow incessantly, forcing Io to wander around aimlessly. This mythological story is often interpreted as a metaphor for the unpredictable and sometimes cruel nature of fate and the gods in ancient Greek mythology.
191 True ['Kim'] Kim by Rudyard Kipling

In Rudyard Kipling's novel "Kim," an Irish orphan named Kimball O'Hara, called Kim, is raised in India. He lives among the locals and gets into adventures before being discovered by his father's old regiment and trained to become a spy for the British Secret Service. This novel is notable for its detailed and engaging portrayal of life in colonial India.
192 False ['Rum Runner'] Bill McCoy was a notorious figure during the Prohibition Era in the United States, known as one of the "bootleggers" who brought illegal alcohol, or "hooch," into the country. The phrase "the Real McCoy" is said to have originated from him due to the exceptional quality control of his liquor.

McCoy's alcohol was reportedly of a higher quality than most other bootleggers' because he obtained it directly from the Caribbean islands and transported it to the U.S. in sealed, unopened bottles. This meant that the liquor was not adulterated or watered down, as was often the case with other bootleggers' products. As a result, McCoy's liquor was known for its high quality and authenticity, leading to the phrase "the Real McCoy" being used to describe anything that is genuine or high-quality.
193 True ['Iron Chancellor'] The nickname you're referring to is "Iron Chancellor," which was bestowed upon Otto von Bismarck. This nickname reflects his strong, unyielding personality and his influential role as the Chancellor of Germany from 1871 to 1890. The term "Iron" signifies his firm determination and the strength of his leadership, while "Chancellor" refers to his political position and title. This nickname is a fitting tribute to Bismarck's significant contributions to the unification of Germany and his implementation of numerous social and political reforms during his tenure.
194 True ['Hamilton'] Laird Hamilton, a big wave surfer, was featured in the documentary 'Riding Giants'. He is indeed married to Gabrielle Reece, a famous volleyball player, model, and actress. Known for tackling some of the biggest waves in the world, Hamilton is a pioneer in tow-in surfing and hydrofoil boarding. His inclusion in 'Riding Giants' was fitting, as the documentary explores the history and culture of big wave surfing.
195 True ['Machu Picchu'] Machu Picchu is the 'Lost City' that Hirem Bingham was led to by Melchor Arteaga in 1911. It is important to note that Bingham was not searching for Machu Picchu, but rather for Vilcabamba, the last refuge of the Inca Empire. However, his discovery of Machu Picchu significantly contributed to the site's global recognition and preservation.
196 True ['Manolo Blahnik'] Manolo Blahnik, the Spanish fashion designer renowned for his high-end women's shoes, provided his creative skills to Sofia Coppola's film "Marie Antoinette." Known for his stylish and often extravagant stilettos, Blahnik's designs were a perfect fit for the film's opulent aesthetic and the lavish lifestyle of the historical figure. The film, set in the late 18th century, follows the life of the last queen of France before the French Revolution, making Blahnik's involvement a wonderful blend of historical elegance and modern fashion sensibilities.
197 True ['Aruba'] The colorful Dutch Colonial style buildings are most commonly associated with the Netherlands, but if you're looking for such architecture in the Caribbean, specifically on the island of Aruba, you would find them in Oranjestad, the capital city. This is because Aruba was a Dutch colony and the Dutch influence remains strong in its architecture, culture, and language.
198 False ['Solarization'] The photographic effect that is 12 letters long and reverses tones while introducing highlights to images is "chiaroscuro effect". This effect is often used in black and white photography to create a strong contrast between light and dark areas, giving the image a sense of depth and dimension. The term "chiaroscuro" itself comes from the Italian words 'chiaro' meaning light and 'scuro' meaning dark.
199 True ['Bartleby'] The character you're referring to is Bartleby, the protagonist of Herman Melville's short story "Bartleby, the Scrivener." Bartleby is a copyist who works for a lawyer in his office. At the beginning of the story, Bartleby is described as being able to notice the brick walls of the surrounding buildings from his office window. However, as the story progresses, Bartleby becomes increasingly resistant to work and eventually stops working altogether.

Eventually, Bartleby is fired, but he refuses to leave the office. The lawyer, who has grown fond of Bartleby, tries to help him find new employment, but Bartleby only responds by saying, "I would prefer not to." Eventually, the authorities are called, and Bartleby is taken to prison. It is in prison that Bartleby is described as staring at the high walls of his cell, reflecting the isolation and detachment that have come to define his existence.
200 False ['Quincy Jones'] The individual you're referring to is Michael Jackson. He did not entirely quit music after his treatment for an aneurysm, but rather, he continued to produce and perform music, which includes the famous song "We Are the World." However, it is crucial to clarify that Jackson's doctors did not force him to quit music; instead, they treated his medical condition, allowing him to continue his musical career.
201 True ['Tikrit'] Saddam Hussein was born near Tikrit, a city on the west bank of the Tigris, in 1937. He was indeed found in the vicinity of this city during the Iraq War in 2003, in a operation by the U.S. military. Tikrit is a significant city in Iraq as it was the birthplace of Saddam Hussein and the center of power for his Ba'ath Party.
202 True ['Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'] Ah, the film you're referring to is "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," a delightful excursion from historical accuracy into the realm of fantasy and horror. Benjamin Walker, an accomplished actor, stepped into the presidential shoes for this 2012 movie, playing a version of Abraham Lincoln that most history books would never dare to imagine.

This film is a prime example of what I like to call "recreational history," where facts are free to intermingle with fiction, creating a unique narrative that can be enjoyed much like a thrilling theme park ride. While it's always important to maintain a healthy respect for historical accuracy, there's also something to be said for the entertainment value of such monstrous mash-ups!
203 True ['Jemison'] Nichelle Nichols, the actress who played Lieutenant Uhura in the original "Star Trek" series, was indeed a source of inspiration for many. However, it's important to note that she herself did not become an astronaut. She did, however, advocate for NASA and helped recruit astronauts, including Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman to travel in space. Dr. Jemison flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992.

Dr. Jemison, an engineer, physician, and NASA astronaut, is a true trailblazer. She has often cited Nichelle Nichols as an inspiration, highlighting the importance of representation in media.
204 True ['Belshazzar'] Belshazzar is the correct answer, often mistakenly believed to be the son of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel. However, according to historical records, Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus and was made coregent by his father. He is famous for the Feast of Belshazzar, where he saw the writing on the wall, as described in the Book of Daniel. The fall of Babylon occurred during his rule, and he was indeed killed, contrary to Nebuchadnezzar's fate.
205 True ['Martin McDonagh'] The playwright you're referring to is Martin McDonagh. He is a British-Irish playwright and filmmaker. One of his well-known plays is "The Cripple of Inishmaan." McDonagh recently made a film named "The Banshees of Inisherin," which shares a similar title and setting with "The Cripple of Inishmaan." The new film is set on a fictional island off the coast of Ireland, similar to the real-life Inishmaan. Please note that this response is based on the information available up to October 2021, and the film was reported to be in post-production at that time.
206 True ['Mohs'] The scale you're referring to is likely the Mohs Hardness Scale, which measures the scratch resistance of various minerals. Talc, with a hardness of 1, is the softest mineral on this scale. However, it's important to note that the Mohs scale is a relative scale, and it doesn't directly measure the resistance of a surface to scratching in terms of a numerical value. Instead, it ranks minerals based on their relative hardness, with talc being the softest and diamond being the hardest (with a hardness of 10).
207 True ['White Noise'] The name of the rock band "The Airborne Toxic Event" comes from Don DeLillo's novel "White Noise." This novel has not been adapted into a movie in 2022, as of the time I am providing this answer. There was a film adaptation project announced, but it did not come to fruition by 2022. Please check the latest sources for updates on this topic.
208 True ['Karnak'] The Karnak Temple Complex, a significant religious site in ancient Egypt, is located on the east bank of the Nile River, not the west bank as mentioned in the question. This temple complex is indeed part of the ancient city of Thebes' ruins, now modern-day Luxor. Karnak is famous for its vast hypostyle hall, numerous obelisks, and the sacred lake. The confusion might arise from the fact that the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, also associated with Thebes, are located on the west bank of the Nile.
209 True ['Dan Rostenkowski'] The Illinois politician who went from power in the U.S. House to prison in the 1990s was Dan Rostenkowski. He was a Democratic congressman who represented Illinois's 5th district for 18 terms from 1959 to 1995. He was the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, but in 1994, he was indicted on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice in a long-running investigation of the House Post Office. He eventually pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges and served 15 months in prison. His downfall marked the end of an era in Illinois and national politics.
210 True ['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but your question seems to contain some inaccuracies. Mario Vargas Llosa is a Peruvian writer and Nobel Prize laureate in Literature (2010). However, there is no record of him giving other South American Nobelists a "literal black eye" in 1976 or any other time.

It is important to note that there are only three Nobel laureates in Literature from South America: Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Colombia, 1982), Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru, 2010), and Octavio Paz (Mexico, 1990). There is no evidence to suggest that Vargas Llosa had any physical altercations with them.

If you have any further questions or need information on a different topic, please let me know!
211 True ['Kepler'] Johannes Kepler, a profound astronomer, succeeded Tycho Brahe as the 'Imperial Mathematician' in 1601. Contrary to some misconceptions, it was not Galileo Galilei. Kepler was known for his laws of planetary motion and his role in the scientific revolution. This transition of responsibilities set the stage for Kepler to further analyze and use Brahe's meticulous astronomical data, which eventually led to the formulation of his famous laws.
212 True ['Philip Glass'] The composer who created 'A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close' is Philip Glass, an influential composer in the minimalist movement. Chuck Close, a renowned photorealistic painter, reciprocated the tribute by painting a portrait of Glass titled 'Phil'. Glass and Close have been friends for many years, and their collaboration is a testament to the mutual respect and admiration they have for each other's work.
213 True ['Dangerous Liaisons'] The Starz series "Dangerous Liaisons" is a prequel to the classic novel "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. This TV show explores the early lives of the characters Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who are well-known for their manipulations and romantic intrigues. The series reimagines these characters in their teenage years, as they navigate the treacherous waters of high society and youthful desires.

In the original novel, the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont are already seasoned and cynical players in the game of love and social status. However, the Starz prequel offers a fresh perspective by delving into their formative years, shedding light on how they became the ruthless and calculating individuals they are in the novel.

"Dangerous Liaisons" is a captivating and visually stunning series that combines elements of romance, drama, and intrigue. It is a must-watch for fans of period dramas and those who enjoy exploring the complexities of human relationships and desires.
214 True ['polyglot'] The word you're looking for is "polyglot." It's an impressive title for someone who can speak, write, or understand multiple languages. If you're ever in the company of a polyglot, you might want to ask them about their language-learning journey and the fascinating cultures they've explored through linguistic diversity.
215 True ['China'] The Misty Poets, also known as the Obscure Poets, were a group of Chinese poets who emerged during the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were part of China's "Misty" or "Obscure" poetry movement, which was a response to the strict literary controls of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). The Misty Poets sought to break away from the revolutionary slogans and social realism that dominated Chinese literature during the Maoist era, instead embracing individualism, free expression, and experimentation with language and form.

The Misty Poets included notable figures such as Bei Dao, Gu Cheng, Duo Duo, and Shu Ting. Their work was often met with censorship and repression by the Chinese government, but they continued to write and publish their poetry both within China and abroad.

Therefore, the Misty Poets were based in China, and their work was a significant cultural development in the country's post-Cultural Revolution era.
216 True ['Wings'] No war film won the first Best Picture Oscar. The first Best Picture Oscar, known as the Academy Award for Outstanding Picture, was awarded in 1929 to "Wings," an epic silent film about World War I pilots. However, the term "Best Picture" was not used until 1962. Before that, the award was simply called the Academy Award for Outstanding Picture.
217 True ['Bearer Bond', 'Bearer Bonds'] In banking and finance, "B.B." often stands for "bearer bonds." Bearer bonds are a type of debt security that does not have a registered owner and is payable to the person who holds the certificate. This means that the bondholder is the legal owner of the instrument and can claim the interest and principal payments simply by possessing the bond certificate.

Bearer bonds have become less common due to concerns about money laundering, tax evasion, and theft. Many countries have either restricted or outright banned the issuance of bearer bonds. In the United States, for example, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 effectively prohibited the issuance of new bearer bonds by making them subject to immediate income tax liability. However, bearer bonds issued before this date can still circulate and be redeemed.

It is essential to note that bearer bonds are different from registered bonds, where the issuer maintains a record of the bondholder's identity, and the interest and principal payments are made via check or electronic transfer to the registered owner's bank account. Registered bonds are more common and preferred in modern financial markets due to their enhanced security and regulatory compliance features.
218 False ['Superannuated'] The term you're referring to is "antiquated." It comes from the Latin "antiquus," which means "old" or "ancient." While not exactly meaning "over one year old," its connotation of being "out of date" or "no longer in use" is akin to the concept of obsolescence. It's worth noting that Latin does have a specific term for "over one year old" - "anniculus" - but this doesn't directly translate to "obsolete" or "antiquated."
219 True ['V.S. Naipaul'] V.S. Naipaul, a Trinidad-born author, is the correct answer to the question; however, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, not 1998. "A House for Mr. Biswas" is one of his most renowned works, published in 1961. Naipaul was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories. It is important to note that while the year was incorrect, the achievement and author are accurate.
220 True ['Eris'] Eris, a dwarf planet in our solar system, is comparable in size to Pluto. It was named after the Greek goddess of strife and discord due to the disruption it caused in the classification of planets following its discovery in 2005. Its discovery led the International Astronomical Union to redefine the definition of a planet, which ultimately resulted in Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet as well.
221 False ['Bismarck'] The Admiralty Islands were not under German control from 1885 to 1914 along with the rest of a specific sea in the southwest Pacific. The Admiralty Islands were actually a part of German New Guinea, which was a German protectorate from 1884 to 1914. German New Guinea was not a sea, but a group of islands in the southwest Pacific, including the northeastern part of the island of New Guinea and several nearby island groups, such as the Admiralty Islands. The Admiralty Islands were occupied by Australian forces during World War I and were later mandated to Australia by the League of Nations. They are now part of the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.
222 True ['Samuel Beckett'] The Irish playwright who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969 and wrote in both English and French is Samuel Beckett. He is best known for his plays in English, notably "Waiting for Godot," but he was also fluent in French and wrote many of his works in that language. Beckett was a key figure in the modernist movement and is considered one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. His work often explores themes of alienation, isolation, and the human condition. He died in 1989.
223 True ['Topkapi'] Topkapi Palace, the correct name of the fabled palace built by Sultan Mehmed II, is derived from its location near the Sea of Marmara and the Istanbul district of Eminönü, known as the Cannon Gate or Topkapi in Turkish. This palace served as the main residence and administrative headquarters of the Ottoman sultans for centuries. It's now a significant museum featuring an extensive collection of Ottoman Empire artifacts and relics.
224 True ['Murmansk'] Murmansk is the largest city in the world located north of the Arctic Circle. Unlike many ports in the Arctic, Murmansk does not freeze in winter due to the warm North Atlantic Current, making it a crucial ice-free port in the region. This gives it year-round access to the Atlantic Ocean, which is a significant strategic and economic advantage.
225 False ['The Triplets of Belleville', 'Les Triplettes de Belleville'] I must admit that your question left me somewhat baffled, as it seems to combine elements of two different topics: musically gifted sister trios and a French film from 2003 about a kidnapped cyclist. After a bit of research, I believe you may be referring to the film "SWIMMING POOL" directed by François Ozon. However, I must clarify that this film does not feature a trio of musically gifted sisters, and the plot revolves around a mystery writer, not a kidnapped cyclist.

If you could provide more context or clarify your question, I would be happy to help further.
226 True ['Zanzibar'] Zanzibar

Sultan Khalid Bin Barghash ruled Zanzibar for about two days, from August 25 to August 27, 1896. His reign was marked by a short war known as the Anglo-Zanzibar War, which was fought against the British Empire. The war began when Sultan Khalid refused to step down and hand over power to his British-backed cousin, Hamad bin Thuwaini's chosen successor, Hamoud bin Mohammed. The British, who wanted to maintain their influence in Zanzibar, considered Khalid's ascension to the throne illegal and demanded his immediate removal.

The Anglo-Zanzibar War was the shortest war in history, lasting only around 38 to 45 minutes. The British bombarded the sultan's palace with artillery, while Khalid's forces, which were significantly outgunned, returned fire with small arms. Eventually, Khalid and his forces retreated, and he sought refuge in the German consulate. The war ended with the British installing Hamoud bin Mohammed as the new sultan of Zanzibar. Khalid was eventually exiled to Dar es Salaam, where he lived until his death in 1927.
227 True ['Luanda'] The city you're referring to is Luanda. It's not only the capital but also the largest city and the chief seaport of Angola. Situated on Angola's Atlantic coast, Luanda is a vital center for the country's economy and industry. It's a fascinating blend of modernity and history, with a bustling urban scene alongside colonial architecture and remnants of its rich past.
228 True ['Oliver Cromwell'] The statement "Cruel Necessity" was made by Oliver Cromwell, who served as Lord Protector after Charles I was executed. Cromwell was a significant figure during the English Civil War and supported the Parliamentarian forces against Charles I, whom he believed was tyrannical. After the war, the King was put on trial and executed in 1649, leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, with Cromwell as its head. Cromwell's comment about the King's execution being a "Cruel Necessity" reflects the difficult decision he and others faced in removing a monarch from power, even if it meant ending a life.
229 True ['Allocution'] The word you're looking for is "allocution." It is indeed related to the word "eloquent," as both come from the Latin word "loqui," meaning "to speak." In a legal context, allocution refers to a defendant's statement to the court before sentencing. This gives the defendant an opportunity to express remorse, explain any extenuating circumstances, or make any other relevant comments before the judge imposes a sentence. It's a critical moment in the legal process, allowing the defendant to have a direct say in the outcome of their case.
230 True ['Lester Bangs'] Lester Bangs, the character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the movie "Almost Famous," was based on a real-life music critic. Lester Bangs was a renowned American music critic and author, known for his work in the late 1960s through the 1970s and early 1980s. He wrote for several publications, including Rolling Stone and Creem magazines.

The book "Let It Blurt: The Life and Times of Lester Bangs, America's Greatest Rock Critic" is a biography about Lester Bangs written by Jim DeRogatis. It was published in 2000 and provides an in-depth look at the life and career of this influential music critic.

As for the book about Blondie, there are several books about the band, but one notable one is "Blondie's Parallel Lines" by Katherine Lipson, which focuses on the band's breakthrough album "Parallel Lines." However, Lester Bangs did not write this book.
231 False ['Elmore Leonard Nimoy'] The correct answer is Elmore Leonard. He is the author of the "Get Shorty" novel and appeared in a Star Trek film where he urged viewers to "Live Long and Prosper." This response combines the ideas of "before" (the author of a famous work) and "after" (his appearance in a film).
232 True ['Cyrus the Great'] The historical figure who Jews have warm and positive feelings for is Cyrus the Great, the Persian king who conquered Babylon and issued a decree in 538 BC that allowed the Jews to return to their homeland, ending the Babylonian captivity. This decree is recorded in the Bible in the Book of Ezra, and Cyrus is even referred to as "the Lord's anointed" in Isaiah 45:1.

Cyrus is remembered for his tolerance and respect for the cultures and religions of the peoples he conquered. His decree allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. This act of generosity and religious freedom has made Cyrus a significant figure in Jewish history and tradition.
233 True ['Prince Albert'] I believe there may be a misunderstanding in your question. His Serene Highness, Prince of Monaco, Marquis of Baux is officially known as Prince Albert II. The term "Man about Town" and "Dude with some pull" are informal phrases that are not officially part of his titles. So, the answer to your question would simply be "Prince Albert II."
234 True ['Aye-Aye'] The aye-aye, a nocturnal strepsirrhine primate native to Madagascar, has been described with such unflattering comparisons. Its distinct features include large eyes, rodent-like teeth, and bushy tail, but it's the eerily elongated middle finger used for tapping on tree trunks to locate grubs that is most reminiscent of a bird's beak or a bat's claw. This unique lemur is not actually related to possums, bats, or rats, but its unusual appearance has led to these descriptions. The aye-aye is the world' largest native primate and is currently classified as endangered due to habitat loss and hunting.
235 False ['Downtrodden'] Paul Auster did not write "The New Colossus" or turn the Statue of Liberty into a symbol of hope for any specific group of people. "The New Colossus" is a sonnet written by American poet Emma Lazarus in 1883, and it includes the famous lines "Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore." These lines are inscribed on a plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty and have come to symbolize the United States as a land of opportunity and refuge for immigrants and outcasts. Paul Auster is a different author, known for his novels, essays, and poetry.
236 False ['For Your Eyes Only'] The collection of short stories you're referring to is "Solo" by William Boyd. It was released in 2013 as part of the James Bond series, but it is not one of the original Ian Fleming novels. The book features a separate story for each word in its title, and the subtitle "Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond" refers to five short stories within the collection. These stories provide a unique look into the life and experiences of the famous British spy, James Bond.
237 True ['Dawn Treader'] In the Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis, Lord Drinian is not a captain of a title vessel but is the captain of the ship, the Dawn Treader, in the third book, "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader." He serves King Caspian X of Narnia during their voyage to find the seven lost lords of Narnia.
238 False ['Cats Cradle'] The chapters "Ice-Nine" and "Tutored by Bokonon" are found in the novel "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut. "Cat's Cradle" is a satirical novel that was first published in 1963. It tells the story of John, a man who is writing a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and his interactions with the children of Felix Hoenikker, a fictional physicist who is one of the inventors of the atomic bomb. The novel explores themes of science, religion, and the human condition, and it is known for its dark humor and unique narrative structure. "Ice-Nine" is a key concept in the novel, representing a form of ice that is stable at room temperature and can cause all water to freeze upon contact. "Tutored by Bokonon" is a chapter in which the main character learns about the fictional religion of Bokononism, which is a central element of the novel's plot.
239 True ['Coho'] The answer is "alew," which is a type of four-letter silver salmon contained within the word "booze." This salmonid fish species is often found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific regions. The word "booze" is a well-known slang term for alcoholic beverages.
240 False ['Calla'] Tiger Lilies, also known as Lilium lancifolium, are a variety of lily that features vibrant, colorful flowers. They are named for their distinctive, ornate patterns that resemble the stripes of a tiger, often in hues of red, orange, and yellow. These flowers are quite popular in gardens due to their attractive appearance and hardy nature.
241 True ['Bubba Ho-Tep'] The quote "'Just what are you getting at, Elvis?', 'I think you know what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President. We're gonna kill us a mummy.'" is from the movie "Bubba Ho-Tep". This is a 2002 American comedy horror film directed by Don Coscarelli, based on the 1994 short story of the same name by Joe R. Lansdale. The film stars Bruce Campbell as Sebastian Haff, an elderly man who claims to be Elvis Presley and Ossie Davis as Jack, a man who believes he is John F. Kennedy. The two residents of a nursing home in Texas battle a mummy who is terrorizing the residents.
242 True ['Isle of Wight'] The Isle of Wight, located in the English Channel, was home to Queen Victoria's vacation residence, Osborne House. This island is now its own administrative county in England, making it the correct answer. Queen Victoria spent many of her summers on this island, enjoying the peaceful seaside atmosphere.
243 False ['Formaldehyde'] The uncapped or abandoned oil wells in the USA can release various harmful gases and substances, including methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene. Among these, benzene is a known carcinogen and is also used as an embalming agent.

Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet odor. It evaporates quickly when exposed to air and dissolves slightly in water. Benzene is primarily used in the United States as a starting material in making other chemicals, including plastics, rubber, resins, and synthetic fibers, such as nylon and polyester. It is also used as a solvent in some chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing and in the production of some types of gasoline and other fuels.

Exposure to benzene can cause various health problems, including dizziness, headaches, and skin and eye irritation. Long-term exposure can lead to more severe health issues, such as anemia, damage to the immune system, and an increased risk of cancer, particularly leukemia. Therefore, it is crucial to address the issue of uncapped or abandoned oil wells to prevent the release of harmful substances like benzene into the environment.
244 False ['Berkshires'] The Williamstown Theater Festival is indeed located in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, and both Olympia Dukakis and Christopher Reeve have acted in productions there. The festival is known for its high-quality productions and has been a stepping stone for many well-known actors.
245 False ['Ceres'] Ah, you're asking about our solar system's celestial bodies! The dwarf planet that orbits the sun closer than Neptune is none other than Pluto. Although it's been classified as a dwarf planet since 2006, Pluto still holds an important place in our solar system's history and our understanding of these fascinating cosmic entities.

You know, just like in geology where we classify and categorize rocks and minerals to better understand the Earth's structure and formation, so too do astronomers use classifications to learn more about the universe. It's all interconnected, this beautiful quest for knowledge!
246 False ['Arthur Ashe'] The speaker who says this line is the protagonist, Juan Diego Molina. However, it's important to note that this is a quote from the novel "Days of Grace" ("Días de gracia") by Mexican author Alvaro Enrigue, and the scene described is not a real-life encounter between Juan Diego and Jimmy Connors. The novel is a work of fiction.
247 True ['Rhone', 'Rhône'] The Rhone River is the water body that starts from Lake Geneva, specifically at its eastern end, and flows for roughly 500 miles before reaching the Mediterranean Sea near Marseilles, France. This river is quite significant in terms of both historical and commercial importance, as it has been used for transportation and power generation for centuries.
248 True ['todo el mundo'] The phrase you're looking for is "todo el mundo". While it literally translates to "all the world", it is often used in Spanish to mean "everybody" or "everyone". It's a common expression in Spanish and is widely used in various Spanish-speaking countries. However, it's important to note that the context and usage can slightly change the meaning, so it's always good to be aware of the context when using or interpreting this phrase.
249 True ['John Singer Sargent'] The painter of the official White House portrait of Theodore Roosevelt, which he praised highly, was John Singer Sargent. Known for his evocative portraits, Sargent created a strikingly candid depiction of Roosevelt, who was reportedly pleased with the result. This just goes to show that even presidents appreciate a great piece of art!
250 True ['Pump and Dump', 'Pump Dump', 'Pumping and Dumping', 'Pumping Dumping', 'pump-and-dump'] The scheme you're referring to is known as a "pump and dump" scheme. This is a form of securities fraud where the perpetrators use false, misleading information to hype a stock and artificially inflate its price. Once the price is high enough, the perpetrators sell their shares, resulting in significant profits for themselves while causing losses for those who bought in at the inflated price.

The scheme typically involves the use of aggressive marketing tactics, such as spam emails, social media posts, and telemarketing calls, to spread misinformation and create a buying frenzy around the stock. Once the price has been pumped up, the perpetrators dump their shares and disappear, leaving unsuspecting investors with worthless or significantly devalued stocks.

Pump and dump schemes are illegal and can result in severe penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and damage to one's reputation. It's important for investors to be cautious and do their due diligence before making any investment decisions, and to be wary of any investment opportunities that seem too good to be true.
251 True ['Dalí', 'Dali'] In his memoir "My Last Sigh," Luis Buñuel recounts a surreal encounter with the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. He describes an episode where Dalí attempted to seduce women by placing fried eggs on their shoulders, claiming that he was growing bacteria for his experiments. This is a testament to Dalí's eccentric and surreal personality.
252 False ['baptism'] In Luke 3, it is described that Jesus, at around the age of 30, went to John the Baptist to be baptized. This was not a ritual of purification or forgiveness for himself, as he was without sin, but rather a fulfillment of righteousness and a public identification with the message of repentance that John was preaching. It was a significant event in Jesus' ministry, marking the beginning of his public ministry and his identification with humanity.
253 True ['factorial'] The "!" in mathematics is known as the factorial function. It is a function used with non-negative integers, which means it can be used with whole numbers that are zero or greater. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For example:

* 3! is equal to 3 * 2 * 1, which is 6.
* 4! is equal to 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which is 24.
* 5! is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which is 120.

So, in the case of 3 * 2 * 1 being expressed as 3!, the "!" refers to the factorial function, and it means that you are taking the factorial of the number 3.
254 False ['Ullman'] The hilarious British actress you're referring to is the multi-talented Rose Matafeo! However, you might have misremembered a few details. While Rose Matafeo is a brilliant comedian who hails from New Zealand (not Britain, although she's now based in the UK), she did not play Betty Friedan in the critically acclaimed TV miniseries 'Mrs. America'. Instead, she starred in her own sketch series called 'Starstruck'. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's another query I can help you with!
255 True ['Niger'] The Songhai Empire was located in what is now modern Mali and parts of Niger, not in a single modern nation state. It was indeed one of the largest West African empires in history, but it did not belong to any specific nation as we define them today, as the concept of nation states did not exist during the period of the Songhai Empire. It eventually fell in the 16th century due to a combination of internal issues and external invasions, particularly the Moroccan invasion in 1591.
256 True ['scallop'] The main ingredient in Coquilles St. Jacques is scallops. This classic French dish is named after the French term for scallops, "coquilles Saint-Jacques," and it typically includes sautéed scallops in a white wine and cream sauce, served in their shells and topped with breadcrumbs and cheese before being browned in the oven.
257 True ['mitochondria', 'mitochondrion'] The 1957 Scientific American article that referred to the mitochondria as the "powerhouse of the cell" was published in March of that year and was titled "The Mighty Mitochondria." The article was authored by Dr. Philip Siekevitz and detailed the groundbreaking research on these organelles conducted by him and his colleagues at Rockefeller University.

At the time, the understanding of mitochondria's role in cellular respiration and energy production was still in its infancy. However, Dr. Siekevitz and his team had already discovered that mitochondria contained the enzymes necessary for the final steps of cellular respiration, which generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of cells.

The term "powerhouse of the cell" was used to emphasize the critical role mitochondria play in generating energy for the cell, and it has since become a widely used and enduring metaphor for these remarkable organelles.
258 True ['deadlocked'] Deadlocked might be the word the sports writer is looking for. This 10-letter adjective is often used to describe a situation where both sides in a competition, such as a sports match, are equal, and neither is able to gain an advantage or win. This results in a tie or draw. The word "titanic" in the question suggests a hard-fought or intense competition, which is why "deadlocked" might be an appropriate description.
259 True ['Quisling'] The person you're referring to is Vidkun Quisling, the Norwegian politician who led the country during its German occupation in World War II. After Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Quisling's Nazi-inspired party, the Nasjonal Samling, took control of the government with German support. Quisling served as the Minister-President, and his regime collaborated with the Nazis, leading to his name becoming synonymous with the term "traitor." After the war, Quisling was tried, convicted of high treason, and executed in 1945.
260 True ['Harder to Breathe'] Yes, the title of Maroon 5's debut single is "Harder to Breathe." The lyrics include the line "Is there anyone out there?" The song was released in 2002 as the lead single from their debut studio album "Songs About Jane." It became a commercial success and helped the band gain mainstream recognition.
261 True ['Orange'] The Orange River! Stretching over 1,300 kilometers, this historical river forms part of the border between South Africa and Namibia. Named after the South African businessman and politician Ernest Oppenheimer, the bridge is a significant structure that connects the two countries. The river's name comes from its distinctive color, which is attributed to the high iron content in its waters. It is a truly beautiful and vital natural resource in the region.
262 True ['Charley Pride'] Jimmy Allen's song "Down Home" is a tribute to the late Charley Pride, a trailblazing black country singer who died in 2020. Pride's impact on country music is immeasurable, and Allen's song is a heartfelt homage to Pride's legacy. The lyrics include the line "We lost a hero, Charley Pride, down home," acknowledging Pride's passing and celebrating his contributions to the genre.
263 True ['Minoan'] The Phaistos Disc was discovered in the Minoan palace of Phaistos, on the island of Crete. The disc dates back to around 1600 BCE and is inscribed with mysterious hieroglyphic-like symbols. Despite numerous attempts, the script has not been deciphered yet, and the purpose and meaning of the Phaistos Disc remain a mystery. The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization that flourished on the island of Crete and other Aegean islands, and it is known for its advanced art, architecture, and culture.
264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker you're referring to is Michel Foucault. His multi-volume "History of Sexuality" is a groundbreaking work that discusses the relationship between power and sexuality. Foucault, a leading philosopher and social theorist, explores how sexuality has been used as a tool of power and control in society throughout history. He delves into the complex dynamics of power, knowledge, and the body, arguing that sexuality is a social construct used to regulate and discipline individuals. This work is a significant contribution to the fields of sociology, philosophy, and gender studies.
265 True ['Walther'] A fan letter describing the Beretta as "a lady's gun" led Ian Fleming to replace James Bond's preferred firearm from a Beretta to a Walther PPK. This change was first introduced in the novel "Dr. No," published in 1958. The Walther PPK is a compact, reliable, and powerful semi-automatic pistol, which better suited the image of the suave and deadly British secret agent.
266 True ['ooze'] Globigerina ooze is a type of sediment found on the ocean floor that is composed mainly of the calcareous tests (shells) of foraminiferans, a type of single-celled organism. The name "Globigerina" comes from a specific genus of foraminiferans that are particularly common in these oozes. These tests sink to the ocean floor after the organisms die, forming a soft, gooey mud. Globigerina ooze is one of the most common types of deep-sea ooze, covering about 10% of the world's ocean floor. It is typically found at depths of around 4,000 to 5,000 meters, in areas where the water is rich in nutrients and the organisms that produce the tests can thrive.
267 True ['Brave New World'] Ah, that quote is from Aldous Huxley's masterpiece, "Brave New World". It's a fascinatingly disturbing novel set in a future society where people are genetically engineered and conditioned to play specific roles. Soma, a drug that brings about temporary happiness, is used to keep the masses compliant and content, free from any desire for change or rebellion. A fascinating read, it gives one much to ponder about the direction our society could take. If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend adding it to your list!
268 True ['Murray'] The river you're referring to is the Murray River, which is a major river in Australia and the longest river in the country. It spans approximately 1,583 miles or 2,549 kilometers. The Darling River and the Murrumbidgee River are two of its major tributaries.

The Murray-Darling Basin, which includes the Murray River and its tributaries, is the largest and most complex river system in Australia. It covers an area of around 1 million square kilometers, which is approximately 14% of the Australian landmass. The basin is home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including wetlands, forests, and grasslands, and it supports a significant portion of Australia's agricultural industry.

The Murray River begins in the Australian Alps and flows into the Southern Ocean in South Australia. Along the way, it passes through several major cities, including Albury-Wodonga, Murray Bridge, and Mildura, and it is an important source of water for irrigation, industry, and domestic use. However, the river has faced numerous environmental challenges in recent years, including drought, water scarcity, and the impacts of climate change.
269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] The recovery time you mentioned is most commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The dissolving stitches used for closing the incisions after such a procedure typically take around 10-14 days to dissolve, or in some cases, up to three weeks. However, the recovery process for ACL reconstruction can take several months, and athletes often require up to a year to regain full strength, flexibility, and balance in the knee.
270 True ['Morris'] The designer you're referring to is William Morris (1834-1896), a British textile designer, poet, and novelist associated with the 19th-century Arts and Crafts Movement. Although his name might not sound like a typical Hollywood agent, he did create several wallpaper patterns with floral designs, including "Rose" and "Jasmine." Morris's designs were known for their intricate patterns and natural motifs, reflecting his belief in the beauty of craftsmanship and the natural world.
271 True ['Addams Family Values'] The Addams Family Values - This is a before and after title as it follows "The Addams Family" and "Values" can be seen as a value added to the Addams Family. Wednesday and Pugsley, two characters from The Addams Family, are sent to summer camp in this sequel.
272 False ['Done', 'Dun'] Finished and drab are homophones, which are words that sound the same but have different meanings and may have different spellings.

Finished refers to something that has been completed or accomplished. For example:

* She finished her homework an hour ago.
* He finished reading the book in one day.

Drab, on the other hand, refers to something that is dull, lacking in color or interest. For example:

* The drab walls of the room made it feel gloomy.
* She wore a drab outfit that didn't suit her.
273 True ['Zworykin'] Vladimir Zworykin, a Russian engineer, filed a patent for the Iconoscope in 1923. This was a significant step in the development of television technology as the Iconoscope served as the first practical video camera tube. It was capable of converting an image into electrical signals which could then be transmitted and displayed on a screen. However, it's worth noting that Zworykin's 1923 patent application was denied, and he later filed a successful application in 1925 after making further improvements to the design. He is often referred to as the "Father of Television" due to his pioneering work in this field.
274 False ['Sharp Objects and Gone Girl', 'Sharp Objects Gone Girl'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but your question seems to be missing some context. "Sharp Girl" doesn't appear to be a well-known book title or series, and without more information about the author or the specific books you're referring to, it's difficult for me to provide an accurate answer. 

Could you please provide more details? I'd be happy to help once I have a clearer understanding of your question.
275 True ['Bayreuth'] Bayreuth Festival, often simply referred to as the Bayreuth, is a annual music festival held in Bayreuth, Germany. It was specifically established in 1876 by Richard Wagner for the performance of his own operas, with the first one being "The Ring of the Nibelung". The festival takes place in a unique theater built specifically for this purpose, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which is renowned for its excellent acoustics. The festival has a long and rich history, and to this day it is still strongly associated with the works of Richard Wagner.
276 True ['Hoyle'] The name I'm thinking of is Edmond Hoyle. He was a prominent figure in the 18th century, particularly known for his expertise in the card game whist. His writings on the subject were highly influential, and even today, people sometimes use the phrase "According to Hoyle" to indicate that something is an authoritative statement about rules or procedures, especially in games. It's a testament to his enduring influence that his name remains synonymous with card-playing rules and etiquette.
277 True ['Brooklyn Decker'] Brooklyn Decker, the model and actress, is married to Andy Roddick. They met in 2007 and got married in 2009. Brooklyn Decker has graced the covers of magazines like Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and has also acted in shows and movies such as "Grace and Frankie" and "Just Go with It." Roddick is a former professional tennis player, who was once ranked number one in the world. Their love match is one of the more successful and lasting ones in the world of celebrity relationships.
278 True ['Paddock'] The word you're looking for is "paddock." It's a term commonly used in horse racing and equestrian sports. Before a race, horses are often saddled in a specific area called a paddock. This area is also used for exercising and grooming the horses. It's an enclosed space, usually grass-covered, where horses can move around freely before or after a race.
279 True ['wasp'] Wow, New Mexico certainly went with a unique and interesting choice for its state insect! The tarantula hawk is a type of wasp that is known for its distinctive, brightly colored appearance and its unusual predatory behavior.

Tarantula hawks are part of the family Pompilidae, which includes a variety of different wasp species that are known for hunting spiders as a food source for their offspring. These wasps are solitary insects, which means that they do not live in colonies like some other types of wasps and bees.

As their name suggests, tarantula hawks are particularly fond of hunting tarantulas, which are some of the largest and most formidable spiders in the world. These wasps use their long, curved stingers to inject venom into the tarantula, which paralyzes the spider and allows the wasp to drag it back to its burrow.

Once the tarantula is inside the burrow, the female wasp lays a single egg on the spider's abdomen. When the wasp larva hatches, it begins to feed on the still-living tarantula, consuming its internal organs and muscles while leaving the vital organs intact so that the spider can remain alive for as long as possible.

After several weeks of feeding, the wasp larva pupates and eventually emerges as an adult wasp, leaving the now-empty tarantula carcass behind. The entire lifecycle of the tarantula hawk is closely tied to the tarantula, making this wasp species a fascinating example of the complex and often deadly relationships that exist between different types of animals in the natural world.
280 True ['Cronkite'] It seems there's a slight misunderstanding in the question. Peter Mansbridge was a well-known Canadian news anchor, but he was not the "Canadian equivalent" of a specific CBS news anchor who stepped down in 1981. 

The CBS news anchor who stepped down in 1981 was Walter Cronkite, a highly respected figure in American journalism. However, Mansbridge's career trajectory and the era of his prominence are different from Cronkite's, and it would not be accurate to directly equate the two. 

Mansbridge became the chief correspondent for CBC Television in 1992 and the anchor of The National, CBC's nightly news broadcast, in 1995. He held these positions until his retirement in 2017. His career, while significant and influential in Canadian journalism, is not directly related to Walter Cronkite's.
281 True ['Graham'] The evangelist who drew more than 20,000 people in revival meetings in a big tent was Billy Graham. In 1949, he held a series of revival meetings under a large canvas tent in Los Angeles, California, which became known as the "Los Angeles Crusade." The meetings lasted for eight weeks and attracted a total audience of over 350,000 people. The success of these meetings helped to establish Billy Graham as a prominent evangelical Christian leader in the United States.
282 True ['Odenkirk'] The actor who traded the courtroom for the classroom in "Lucky Hank" is Bob Odenkirk. Known for his memorable role as the cunning lawyer Saul Goodman in "Breaking Bad" and its spin-off "Better Call Saul," Odenkirk takes on a new persona as a disenchanted English professor in the AMC series "Lucky Hank." This role showcases his versatility and range as an actor, proving that he is not limited to legal dramas.
283 True ['lowkey'] The slang phrase you're referring to is "lowkey goated when X is the vibe." "Lowkey" is the word that precedes "goated" in this context. "Goated" is a slang term that stands for "greatest of all time," and "lowkey" means something is being kept secret or subtle. So when someone says "lowkey goated when X is the vibe," they mean that something is quietly or subtly great when a certain situation or mood (X) is present.
284 True ['Cloisters'] The Cloisters is a novel by Kyle Mills, which Jenna Bush recommended as a Gothic read. The title and setting of the novel refer to The Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This museum is dedicated to the art and architecture of the European Middle Ages, and it is housed in a building that incorporates elements from several medieval French cloisters. The novel combines historical facts and fiction, creating an eerie and suspenseful atmosphere that is characteristic of Gothic literature.
285 True ['Punchbowl'] There seems to be a misunderstanding. Honolulu, a vibrant city in the Pacific, is the capital of Hawaii, but it does not have a crater called the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Instead, the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific is located within the Punchbowl Crater, also known as Puowaina, in Honolulu. This crater is a dormant volcanic tuff cone, and it serves as a memorial to honor the men and women who served in the United States Armed Forces. Please note that the crater itself is not named after the cemetery; rather, the cemetery is situated inside the crater.
286 False ['Healall'] The flower featured in Robert Frost's poem 'Design' is the "white heal-all", which is a common name for the plant Pentemon whitfordii. This plant is part of the figwort family and is known for its healing properties, hence the name "heal-all". However, it's important to note that Frost uses this common flower as a symbol in his poem to explore deeper themes of design and purpose in the universe.
287 True ['Gastroenteritis'] The term you're referring to is "gastroenteritis". Norovirus is indeed a leading cause of this condition, which is characterized by inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often leading to stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. It's often mistakenly called "stomach flu," but gastroenteritis is not related to the influenza virus. Norovirus is highly contagious and can spread easily in closed places like schools, daycare centers, and nursing homes.
288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] The movie title is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "The Ugly American." In the former, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach are the three main characters who fight for gold in the Western genre film. In the latter, Marlon Brando portrays a character that gives a negative image of Americans abroad, set in a different cultural context.
289 True ['Shinto'] Shinto, an ethnic religion that originated in Japan, associates Torii gates with the boundary between the secular world and the sacred. These gates are often found at the entrance of Shinto shrines, signifying the transition from the mundane to the sacred space. Shinto, meaning "the way of the gods," is a polytheistic religion deeply rooted in Japanese culture and tradition.
290 True ['Reposado'] Ah, the agave-derived delight you're referring to is known as "Añejo" - a term that tequila aficionados use to describe a spirit which has taken quite the siesta, if I may put it in terms we both understand. This type of tequila rests for no less than a year in small oak barrels, often former bourbon casks. The result? A golden hue, much like the sun-kissed plains of Castilla-La Mancha at dusk, and a taste as rich and complex as a conversation with Don Quixote himself. It's quite a step up from its younger sibling, the "Reposado", another Spanish word that graces the world of tequila, meaning 'rested', but for a shorter period of two to twelve months.
291 True ['Stockholm'] August Strindberg, the renowned Swedish playwright, novelist, and painter, did not die in any capital city in 1912. Instead, he died in Stockholm, Sweden, which is the country's largest city and its capital. Strindberg is widely regarded as one of the leading figures of Swedish literature, and his works have had a significant influence on Swedish drama and culture.
292 True ['Hagar'] Hagar

In the biblical account, Sarah (then known as Sarai) was unable to conceive children with her husband Abraham (then known as Abram). Following God's promise that Abraham would become the father of many nations, Sarah gave her Egyptian handmaid, Hagar, to Abraham to bear a child. Hagar conceived and gave birth to Ishmael, who is considered the forefather of the Arab peoples in Islamic tradition and one of the patriarchs of the Islamic faith.
293 True ['Gluon'] Gluons are the particles that bind quarks inside protons and neutrons, revealing their sticky nature. Gluons are fundamental particles that mediate the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for holding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. Unlike the electromagnetic force that is carried by photons and has an infinite range, the strong nuclear force is limited to very short distances and is the strongest of the fundamental forces in nature. The name "gluon" comes from the fact that they "glue" quarks together.
294 True ['Tessera', 'Tessellation', 'tessellated'] The term you're looking for is "tessellation." It refers to a pattern formed by a repeated arrangement of shapes, such as the small squares or tiles in a mosaic, that completely covers a surface without any gaps. Tessellations are found in many types of artwork, including mosaics, and can create intricate and visually striking designs. They have also been used in architecture and mathematics to study geometric properties and patterns.
295 True ['My So-Called Life', 'My So Called Life'] Claire Danes gained recognition for her role as Angela Chase in the series "My So-Called Life." The show, which aired in the mid-1990s, delved into the complex world of teenage life, exploring themes of identity, friendship, and family dynamics. Her nuanced portrayal of Angela resonated with many young viewers, making it a memorable and influential show of its time.
296 True ['coati'] Coati, often mistakenly called "coatimundi," is a short five-letter name for these raccoon-like mammals. They are native to Arizona, New Mexico, and southwards into Central and South America. Coatis are members of the Procyonidae family, making them relatives to raccoons. However, they are more closely associated with the ring-tailed cat and the olingo.
297 True ['Irene Cara'] Irene Cara, the singer and actress who performed "Flashdance...What a Feeling," did live to see her song's significance recognized by the Library of Congress in 2016, when it was included in the National Recording Registry. This prestigious registration acknowledges the cultural, artistic, and/or historical importance of American sound recordings. The song, released in 1983, gained immense popularity and became an iconic element of the '80s pop culture, thanks to its association with the film "Flashdance." Therefore, it is incorrect to say that Cara did not live to see this achievement.
298 True ['JuJu', 'joujou', 'gris'] Gris-gris bags, also known as mojo bags, are commonly found in Voodoo shops. These small cloth bags contain a variety of ingredients, including herbs, stones, crystals, minerals, coins, or other items, that are believed to provide protection, bring good luck, or offer other metaphysical benefits, depending on the specific contents and intentions of the bag's creator. The term "gris-gris" is derived from the Arabic "ghararita," which means "dust, amulet, or charm." These bags are often worn on the person, carried in a pocket or purse, or placed in one's home or car for continuous protection and good fortune.
299 False ['Shelley'] The poet you're referring to is Lord Byron, an English Romantic poet. The phrases allude to his distinctive qualities and works. "Unabashed romantic" refers to his involvement in the Romantic movement. "Unbound" may refer to his poem "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," in which the protagonist travels unbound. Lastly, "drowning, his sorrows" is a reference to the poem "When We Two Parted," where Byron expresses his grief over a lost love.
300 True ['Burundi'] The country you're referring to is Burundi, which is located in East Africa. Despite the Hutu majority, Burundi, like its neighbor Rwanda, has a history of Tutsi minority rule. This power dynamic has been a significant source of conflict in both countries, leading to instances of ethnic violence and civil war. It's important to note that the situation is complex and involves many factors, including colonialism, socio-economic issues, and political tensions.
301 True ['Carillon'] The term you're looking for is "carillon." A carillon is a set of tuned bells in a church or other tall building, which is played serially to create a melody. The number of bells can vary, but traditionally, a carillon has at least 23 bells, with some having as many as 78 bells. This musical instrument is often used in religious services and special occasions, and it's a significant part of many cultural traditions around the world.
302 True ['Leslie Groves'] Leslie Groves is described as the "indispensable man" who oversaw the Manhattan Project, the US effort to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. General Groves was a hard-driving US Army Corps of Engineers officer who was appointed to lead the project in September 1942, just a few months after it was established.

Under Groves' leadership, the Manhattan Project undertook a massive research and development effort that involved thousands of scientists, engineers, and support personnel at sites across the United States. Groves played a key role in selecting the sites for the project, securing the necessary funding and resources, and coordinating the work of the various scientific and engineering teams involved.

Groves' leadership style was characterized by his attention to detail, his ability to make quick decisions, and his determination to get things done. He was known for his blunt and sometimes abrasive manner, but he was also respected for his technical expertise and his ability to manage complex projects.

The successful testing of the first atomic bomb in July 1945 was a testament to Groves' leadership and the efforts of the many scientists, engineers, and support personnel who worked on the Manhattan Project. The bomb was subsequently used in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which helped bring an end to the war in the Pacific. Groves' contributions to the project were recognized with the award of the Distinguished Service Medal, the nation's highest non-combat military honor.
303 True ['Chicago'] Chicago, USA is the city where the Haymarket Square riot took place in 1886. The event began when police dispersed a public assembly during a general strike for an eight-hour workday, leading to the deaths of several police officers and demonstrators. The incident is remembered for the Haymarket Affair, a significant event in the history of the international labor movement. It resulted in the trial and execution of four anarchists, which drew widespread criticism and controversy.
304 True ['Typee'] Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is the novel referred to here, and it was indeed Herman Melville's first published work of fiction. Released in 1846, it is a romance and adventure novel based on Melville's experiences in the South Pacific. The semi-autobiographical novel is a vivid portrayal of Typee, a valley on the Marquesan island of Nuku Hiva. It is noted for its critique of Western civilization and its romanticization of the supposed noble savage. However, Melville's depiction of the island and its people has been criticized for its inaccuracies and romanticized portrayal.
305 True ['griot'] In the movie "Night of the Kings", the central character Roman is a prisoner in the MACA adult prison in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. To avoid being killed by the prison's hierarchically superior inmates, Roman assumes the role of the "dangoro," a West African storyteller or griot. The film is a modern interpretation of traditional West African storytelling, where the griot is responsible for preserving and sharing the community's history, wisdom, and cultural values through oral narratives.

The griot, or djeli in the Mandinka language, is a respected figure in West African societies, particularly in the Mandinka, Wolof, and Bambara cultures. They act as oral historians, musicians, and advisers to the rulers, and their role is passed down through generations.

In "Night of the Kings," Roman's storytelling is a nod to this rich cultural tradition, as he weaves a tale to captivate his audience and survive the night. The film combines the realities of life in a modern African prison with the mythical and magical elements of West African folklore, creating a unique cinematic experience.
306 True ['Eat, Pray, Love', 'Eat Pray Love'] The title of the book by Elizabeth Gilbert that spent 57 weeks as a No. 1 on the New York Times paperback nonfiction bestseller list is "Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia." It is a memoir that was published in 2006 and chronicles the author's journey of self-discovery and personal growth as she travels to Italy, India, and Indonesia after a difficult divorce. The book was a huge success and has been adapted into a feature film starring Julia Roberts.

Here is a set of commands that could be used to describe the tasks performed by the book:

1. Travel to Italy.
2. Eat delicious food and indulge in pleasure.
3. Travel to India.
4. Study and practice meditation and spirituality.
5. Travel to Indonesia.
6. Seek balance and inner peace.
7. Reflect on the journey and share the experiences in a memoir.
307 False ['Marcel'] The answer is "Coiffure André." It is a phrase combining a boy's name, André, and a hairstyling term, 'coiffure.' This name hasn't been popular in France since the 1920s. The reason for its decline in popularity is not explicitly mentioned, but it could be due to changing trends and cultural shifts.
308 True ['Livy'] The scholar you're referring to is Titus Livius, more commonly known as Livy. He was a Roman historian who lived from 59 BC to AD 17. His most famous work, "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" (which translates to "Chronicles from the Foundation of the City"), is a comprehensive history of Rome, covering the period from its founding in 753 BC to the reign of Augustus Caesar.

The sections of his work that discuss the battles against Hannibal are part of Book XXI to Book XXX, which cover the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), a series of conflicts between Rome and Carthage, where Hannibal was a prominent military commander. However, it's worth noting that while Livy's work is extensive and detailed, only about a third of it has survived intact to the present day.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] The book is "White Jacket" by Herman Melville. The phrase "Byron's 'White Jacket'" is not commonly used to mean 'Let's head in a certain direction', but in the context of the book, it could be interpreted as a call to action or a symbol of a journey, as the book is about a young British sailor's experiences on a U.S. Navy ship sailing the Atlantic. The title "White Jacket" refers to the uniform worn by the main character. The phrase is not widely used in this way and is not a common idiom or saying.
310 False ['Pangaea'] Pangea (not "All Earth", but "All Land" or "Entire Earth" in Ancient Greek) is the name of the supercontinent that existed approximately 300 million years ago. It began to break apart around 200 million years ago, forming the continents we know today.
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] The song "War Pigs" is from the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, not from Judas Priest as sometimes mistakenly thought. Released in 1970, this iconic song was intended to criticize the horrors and cruelty of war, and the people who start and perpetuate them. The band members were inspired to write this song after reading about the Vietnam War and its devastating consequences. They likened the actions of warmongers to Satanism, hence the line "Generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses". This powerful anti-war anthem remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] Ah, the place you're thinking of is none other than the Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas! It's a public art installation and roadside attraction that features ten vintage Cadillacs, half-buried nose-first in the ground. This quirky display was created by a group of artists known as The Ant Farm in 1974.

The cars are painted in vibrant colors, and visitors are encouraged to leave their own mark by adding new layers of paint. So, if you ever find yourself in the Lone Star State, don't forget to stop by this iconic spot for a truly unique experience. And remember, hold on tight to your own set of wheels while you marvel at these iconic American classics standing tall, yet buried low!
313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] Tycho Brahe, the renowned 16th century Danish astronomer who had a gold-like nose due to a copper replacement, was discovered in a recent exhumation to have a brass or bronze prosthetic nose. Brahe lost his real nose in a duel over a mathematical dispute. His groundbreaking astronomical observations significantly contributed to the Copernican heliocentric model of our solar system.
314 False ['Peccadillo'] The word you're looking for is "llamarada," which is a Spanish term for a brief or small flame or outburst. The diminutive form of this word is "llamaradita," which can be used to describe a minor fault or quirk. This word contains the 'll' combination, which in Spanish produces a sound similar to the 'y' in "yes." It's worth noting that the use of double 'l' in Spanish has a different pronunciation than in English and is not related to the concept of a "minor fault or quirk" in the same way as the word in the riddle.
315 True ['Xerxes'] The Battle of Salamis in 480 BC was fought between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire under King Xerxes I, who was the son of Darius the Great. This naval battle was a significant turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars, where the outnumbered Greek forces managed to defeat the Persians, preventing them from gaining a strong foothold in Europe. The victory at Salamis was a testament to the Greeks' superior naval tactics and strategy, and it played a crucial role in shaping the course of Western civilization.
316 False ['Air Force Quit'] The before and after phrase could be: "When ice immobilizes a nation's air force, only a keyboard shortcut can break the freeze."

This phrase combines the situation where a nation's military planes get frozen, and the need to hit a combination of keys on a computer (mac or PC) to exit a frozen program or application.
317 True ['Stevens'] The Anchorage International Airport was renamed in 2000 to honor the late Senator Ted Stevens, who served as a senator from Alaska from 1968 to 2009. Stevens was a prominent political figure in Alaska and played a significant role in securing federal funding for various projects in the state, including infrastructure developments and transportation. Renaming the airport after him was a way to recognize his contributions and lasting impact on Alaska.
318 False ['The Way Way Back'] The film is "The Way, Way Back." It's a coming-of-age story about a 14-year-old boy named Duncan who is compelled to face his insecurities during a summer vacation with his mother, her boyfriend, and his daughter. The title "Way, Way Back" refers to the farthest seat in a station wagon, which is where Duncan often finds himself, isolated and lost in thought. The film was well-received for its performances and nostalgic portrayal of summer vacations.
319 True ['fenugreek'] The correct answer is kidney beans and fenugreek leaves. Both of these ingredients with European names are commonly used in the preparation of Iran's national dish, Ghormeh sabzi. However, it's important to note that neither of these ingredients are originally from Europe, but rather, they have been incorporated into various cuisines around the world.

Kidney beans, also known as "lubia" in Persian, are a staple in Ghormeh sabzi. They are native to Central and South America, but have been cultivated and consumed in many parts of the world, including Europe and the Middle East.

Fenugreek leaves, on the other hand, are known as "shanbalileh" in Persian and are native to Western Asia and the Mediterranean region. However, the name "fenugreek" is derived from the Latin word "foenugraecum," which means "Greek hay." This name was given to the herb due to its strong hay-like aroma, and it has stuck ever since.

Together, these two ingredients, along with other ingredients such as herbs, lamb, and dried limes, create the delicious and complex flavors of Ghormeh sabzi.
320 True ['Moldova'] Moldova is the nation you're referring to. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova, which was then part of the Soviet Union and situated south of Ukraine, declared its independence. The country was previously known as the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, but it changed its name to the Republic of Moldova when it gained independence. Moldova became a member of the United Nations the following year, in 1992.
321 True ['Byrd'] Richard Evelyn Byrd, a prominent American explorer, returned to Antarctica in the 1930s, leading several expeditions. His second expedition (1933-1935), known as the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, is the one associated with the rescue and frostbite incident.

During this expedition, Byrd and his team established the first permanent base, Little America, on the Ross Ice Shelf. They conducted extensive geological and meteorological studies, and Byrd himself aimed to fly over the South Pole, which he successfully achieved on November 28, 1935.

However, on his return flight from the South Pole, Byrd and his crew encountered a severe storm, causing them to lose their bearings. They were forced to make an emergency landing on the ice, where they remained stranded for five days. Byrd suffered from frostbite during this ordeal, but they were eventually rescued and returned to Little America.

Byrd's exploration and achievements in Antarctica significantly contributed to the understanding of the continent's geography and climate.
322 True ['Broca'] The area of the left front part of the brain that contains neurons involved in speech function is known as Broca's Area. It is named after Pierre Paul Broca, a French physician and pathologist who discovered this brain region's connection to speech production in the mid-19th century.

Broca's Area is located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe, primarily in the dominant hemisphere, which is usually the left hemisphere in most people. This area is responsible for controlling speech articulation and the motor functions required to produce speech. Damage to Broca's Area can lead to a condition called Broca's aphasia, which is characterized by difficulty speaking and forming grammatically correct sentences, although comprehension of language may remain relatively intact.
323 True ['Kim Philby'] Kim Philby, a British spy and member of the infamous Cambridge Spy Ring, is often suggested as the inspiration for Harry Lime in Graham Greene's 'The Third Man'. Philby was accused of working as a Soviet double agent, and his clandestine activities caused great distrust between Britain and the United States during the Cold War. However, it's important to note that Greene never explicitly confirmed this connection.
324 True ['greenback'] The Greenback Party, active in the 1870s and 1880s, is the U.S. political party you're referring to. This party was named after its primary policy stance, which was to maintain or increase the circulation of Greenbacks—a term used to describe the paper money issued by the Union government during the American Civil War. The Greenback Party was concerned with economic issues, specifically advocating for inflationary policies to help farmers and debtors. This party, however, ceased to exist by the end of the 19th century, as many of its members either rejoined the Democratic Party or became part of the Populist Party.
325 False ['Nutmegger'] The correct answer is New Hampshireians. The clue "some New Englanders aren't Connecticuties but are what, which mentions a spice?" refers to the similar sound between "New Hampshire" and "nutmeg," which is a spice. People from New Hampshire are called New Hampshireians, not to be confused with Connecticutites or "Connecticuties."
326 False ['phlox'] The flower you're referring to is most likely a "dianthus," which is often colloquially called "pinks." The name "pinks" comes from the frilled edge of the flower, which looks like it was cut with pinking shears. When you say "picked them just for you," it suggests a desire to express affection or gratitude, which is a common reason for giving someone flowers.
327 True ['Pictures at an Exhibition'] Ah, you're referring to the fascinating composition "Pictures at an Exhibition" by Modest Mussorgsky. This work is a musical tribute to his dear friend, Viktor Hartmann, who was an artist. After Hartmann's untimely death, a memorial exhibition was held in St. Petersburg featuring over 400 of his artworks.

Mussorgsky was inspired by this exhibition and composed "Pictures at an Exhibition" as a reflection of his emotional journey through it. Each movement represents a different piece of Hartmann's art, capturing the essence and spirit of each artwork in sound. It's a remarkable example of program music, where the composition tells a story or conveys emotions and images outside of the music itself.

Here are the ten movements of "Pictures at an Exhibition" and the artworks they represent:

1. "Promenade" - This movement represents Mussorgsky walking through the exhibition.
2. "The Gnome" - Based on a sketch of a gnome-like figure.
3. "The Old Castle" - Inspired by a drawing of a medieval castle.
4. "Promenade" - Another walk through the exhibition.
5. "Tuileries (Children Quarreling After Games)" - Depicts children playing in the Tuileries Garden in Paris.
6. "Bydlo" (Polish for "Cattle" or "Oxen") - Based on a painting of an ox-cart.
7. "Promenade" - A third walk through the exhibition.
8. "Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks" - Inspired by a sketch of a mechanical ballerina.
9. "Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuyle" - Represents two separate portraits of Jewish men.
10. "The Market at Limoges" - Depicts a bustling market scene in the French city.
11. "Catacombs (Con mortuis in lingua mortua)" - Represents Hartmann's sketches of the Paris catacombs.
12. "The Hut on Fowl's Legs (Baba Yaga)" - Based on a design for a clock in the shape of a hut.
13. "The Great Gate of Kiev" - Inspired by Hartmann's design for a grand entrance gate to the city of Kiev.

As you can see, Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" is a remarkable homage to his friend's art and a fascinating exploration of the connection between music and visual art.
328 False ['Dewey'] Earl Warren did not run as a Vice Presidential candidate five years before becoming the Chief Justice of the United States. In fact, he never ran for the position of Vice President. Earl Warren served as the Governor of California from 1943 to 1953 and was appointed as the Chief Justice of the United States by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. Therefore, there is no Vice Presidential running mate to discuss in relation to Earl Warren five years before his appointment as Chief Justice.
329 True ['phrenology'] Franz Joseph Gall, an 18th-19th century German physiologist, is credited with developing phrenology, a pseudoscience that tried to correlate aspects of personality and character with the shape of the skull. The theory proposed that the brain is the organ of the mind and that the mind has many independent organs, each responsible for specific mental faculties. Phrenology was quite popular in the 19th century but is now discredited due to a lack of empirical evidence supporting its principles.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) - Milan Kundera's novel "Life is Elsewhere" was completed in 1969, but its publication was not allowed in Czechoslovakia, where he resided at the time. The communist regime saw the book as a critique of their system, leading to its censorship in his home country. Kundera eventually had to leave Czechoslovakia in 1975 after facing continued persecution from the government.
331 False ['Tulum'] The Mayan Monkey Hostel in Playa del Carmen, Riviera Maya, could be considered a 'trendy' place to stay. This hostel is popular among young travelers and backpackers looking for a social atmosphere, as it offers a variety of common areas, including a rooftop terrace, a bar, and a movie room. The hostel also frequently organizes events and activities for guests, such as pub crawls, yoga classes, and walking tours.

The Itza Hotel Akumal, on the other hand, is a boutique hotel that caters to a more upscale market. While it may not be considered as 'trendy' as the Mayan Monkey Hostel, it does offer a unique and stylish accommodation option in the Riviera Maya. The hotel features an outdoor pool, a restaurant, and a spa, and is located just a short walk from the beach.

Both options offer a different experience and cater to different types of travelers, so it depends on what you are looking for in your stay in the Riviera Maya.
332 True ['Stefan Urquelle'] Jaleel White's character Steve Urkel, in the TV show "Family Matters," creates a potion in season 5 that transforms him into a suave, confident alter ego named "Stefan Urquelle." This transformation is a significant storyline in the series, often used for comedic effect. Stefan Urquelle becomes a love interest for Laura Winslow, a friend of Steve's, leading to humorous and awkward situations. This plotline is a memorable part of the show's charm.
333 True ['Massachusetts'] Charles Sumner was from the state of Massachusetts. He was a prominent abolitionist and a Senator from Massachusetts when he was severely assaulted on the Senate floor in 1856 by Preston Brooks, a pro-slavery Senator from South Carolina. The attack, which left Sumner badly injured, was in response to a speech Sumner had given condemning slavery and criticizing Brooks' cousin, Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina. The incident highlighted the deep divisions between the North and South and was a harbinger of the American Civil War.
334 True ['Proulx'] The line 'The summer range lay above the tree line on the forest service land on Brokeback Mountain' is from the short story "Brokeback Mountain" by Annie Proulx. The story was published in 1997 in The New Yorker and later became the basis for the award-winning film of the same name. The story follows the lives of two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, who fall in love while working as sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming during the summer of 1963. The story explores the challenges and heartaches the two men face as they try to come to terms with their love for each other in a time and place where homosexuality is not accepted.
335 False ['Winnebago'] The lake you're referring to is Lake Superior, and the Wisconsin island is Madeline Island. It's a wonderful destination for fishing northern pike and largemouth bass. Madeline Island is the largest of the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior and offers beautiful landscapes and various outdoor activities. Always check local regulations and seasons for fishing. Have a great trip!
336 False ['Brancusi'] Constantin Brâncuşi, a Romanian sculptor, is known for his innovative approach to sculpture and his significant contributions to the field. He carved several versions of a piece known as "The Kiss" from stone blocks starting around 1908. Brâncuşi was a pioneer of modernism, and his work has had a lasting impact on the world of art. "The Kiss" is one of his most famous works, and it showcases his unique style and mastery of the medium.
337 True ['Boyhood'] Boyhood (2014) is the film that Lorelei Linklater, the director Richard Linklater's daughter, appeared in as a child actress, with filming taking place over 12 years from 2002 to 2013. During this time, Lorelei Linklater aged from 9 to 21, capturing her character's growth and development on screen.
338 True ['Crossing the Bar'] The title of the poem is "Crossing the Bar." The phrase "crossing the bar" is now commonly used as an idiom for dying, referring to the metaphorical "bar" or boundary between life and death. The poem describes the speaker's journey into the unknown beyond, using the imagery of a ship crossing the sandbar at the mouth of a river to reach the open sea. Tennyson wrote the poem in 1889, just a few years before his own death.
339 True ['Bhutan'] Bhutan is the correct answer. It is the only country in the world where you can't land an airplane using a radar system, and manual landing in daylight is necessary at Paro International Airport, the only international airport in Bhutan. It is located near the capital city Thimphu. This small kingdom is known for its monasteries, fortresses (or dzongs) and dramatic landscapes that range from subtropical plains to steep mountains and valleys.
340 True ['Frankfurter'] The dual biography you're referring to is likely "The Brethren" by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, which covers the Supreme Court during the tenure of Chief Justice Warren Burger from 1969 to 1986. The Vienna-born man in question is Associate Justice Arthur Joseph Goldberg, who served as the third Jewish Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.

Goldberg was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1962, following the retirement of Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter. Goldberg served on the Court until 1965, when he resigned to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under President Johnson.

Prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, Goldberg had a distinguished career in law and public service. He served as the Secretary of Labor under President John F. Kennedy from 1961 to 1962, and was a prominent labor lawyer and negotiator before that.

Goldberg was known for his strong commitment to civil rights and civil liberties, and his tenure on the Supreme Court was marked by a number of significant decisions in these areas. He was succeeded on the Court by Associate Justice Abe Fortas, who was also Jewish.
341 True ['atom'] The 'Plum Pudding' model was an early model of the atomic structure, proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1904. This model suggested that atoms were composed of a positively charged sphere of matter with negatively charged electrons (which Thomson had previously discovered) embedded within it, like plums in a pudding.

However, this model was replaced by the 'Planetary' model, also known as the Rutherford model, after Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment in 1909. In this experiment, alpha particles were fired at a thin gold foil, and it was observed that most of the particles passed straight through the foil, with a few being deflected at large angles. This led Rutherford to conclude that the positive charge in an atom must be concentrated in a small, dense region (which he called the nucleus), with the electrons orbiting around it like planets around the sun. This became the basis of the planetary model of the atom.
342 True ['Nikkei'] The major stock market index in Japan is called the Nikkei 225. It is a price-weighted average of 225 top-rated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei 225 is widely considered to be the leading benchmark for the Japanese equity market. It is similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the United States, which is also a price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks. However, it is important to note that the Nikkei 225 and the DJIA are not directly comparable, as they are calculated using different methods and include different types of companies.
343 True ['Aeschylus'] The ancient play that the actors rehearse in Jacques Rivette's film "Out 1" is "Seven in One Blow, or The Brave Little Tailor" (in French: "Le Petit Poucet"), which is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault, not an ancient Greek tragedy by Aeschylus as one might infer. The confusion likely arises from the fact that the actors are rehearsing a play within a play, and the title "Seven against Thebes" is mentioned at one point, but it is not the play that they are actually rehearsing in the film.
344 True ['connoisseur'] Connoisseur, a term for a person highly knowledgeable and appreciative of the arts, is derived from the French word "connaître," which means "to know." This term, often associated with experts in fine arts, wine, or cuisine, signifies a profound understanding and admiration for artistic and cultural expressions.
345 True ['Mumbai'] I believe you're referring to the city of Bombay (now Mumbai), where Rudyard Kipling was born in 1865. The city has indeed grown into a massive metropolis since then. However, I'm not sure which art school you're mentioning. There are several art schools in Mumbai, such as the Sir J.J. School of Art, which is one of the oldest art institutions in India. If you could provide more specific details, I would be happy to help further.
346 True ['The Little Foxes'] The "Small" drama you're referring to is "The Little Foxes" by Lillian Hellman. This play is set in Alabama in 1900 and revolves around the ruthless, greedy Hubbard family and their manipulations to increase their wealth. The title refers to a biblical quote, "The little foxes that spoil the vines," symbolizing the small, seemingly insignificant actions that can lead to greater ruin. The story primarily focuses on Regina Giddens and her brothers, Ben and Oscar, who hatch a plan to open a cotton mill, which would bring them immense wealth, even if it means resorting to underhanded and immoral tactics.
347 False ['Histrionic'] The 1932 article about Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) is likely referring to his "unexpected" ability to deliver powerful and engaging speeches, with a flair for the dramatic. This quality was valued in politics because it helped FDR connect with his audience, convey his messages effectively, and inspire confidence during challenging times.

At the time, the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression, and FDR's ability to communicate hope and optimism through his speeches played a significant role in his election as the 32nd President of the United States. His speeches often included storytelling, humor, and anecdotes, which made them more relatable and memorable to the general public.

One of FDR's most famous speeches, his first inaugural address, delivered on March 4, 1933, is a prime example of his dramatic speaking style. In this speech, FDR famously said, "So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance." This line, delivered with conviction and emotion, helped to instill a sense of hope and determination in the American people during a time of great uncertainty and hardship.

FDR's dramatic speaking style was a significant part of his political success, as it allowed him to effectively communicate his vision and build a strong connection with the American people.
348 True ['Kafka'] The individual you're referring to is Franz Kafka, who would later become renowned for his unsettling and surreal tales. The Bar Mitzvah ceremony, a significant coming-of-age ritual in Judaism, indeed took place on June 13th, 1896, marking Kafka's transition into religious adulthood. However, it's important to note that while his literature is known for its disturbing and enigmatic qualities, these characteristics were not typically associated with him during his formative years.
349 False ['Maxwell'] The character who uses his 'Silver Hammer' in the song by The Beatles is a character named Max. He is a sort of metaphorical figure of speech for someone who is carrying out justice or punishment in a brutal and harsh manner. The song's lyrics describe Max using the silver hammer to take out various characters, including a quizzical Joan, an annoyed school teacher, and even the judge at his trial. It's important to note that the song is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a darkly humorous and satirical commentary on the nature of justice and punishment.
350 True ['Morgan'] The Welsh buccaneer you're referring to who became the Deputy Governor of Jamaica in 1674 is Henry Morgan. He was a prominent privateer who raided Spanish settlements in the Caribbean and later was appointed to official positions in Jamaica. It is indeed fitting to raise a glass of branded rum in his name, as he was a significant figure in the history of rum production and consumption.
351 False ['Lincoln'] I don't have real-time information or personal access to databases to verify deaths. However, I can tell you that there are a few notable figures in history who died on April 15, but none are commonly featured on currency.

For example, Leonardo da Vinci, the famous Italian polymath, died on April 15, 1519. However, he is not typically associated with any currency. 

If you're thinking of a specific currency, I could provide a more precise answer. Could you please specify the currency you're interested in?
352 True ['Maurier'] The suspenseful and chilling short story "The Birds" was penned by none other than Daphne du Maurier, a renowned British author. This unsettling tale of a sudden, unprovoked attack on the human population by flocks of birds was later adapted into a major motion picture by the legendary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock in 1963. This cinematic adaptation, also titled "The Birds," has since become a classic thriller, renowned for its ability to provoke unease and fear.
353 True ['Haydn'] Joseph Haydn, a prominent Austrian composer, wrote the music for Germany's national anthem, "Deutschlandlied" ("Song of Germany"). However, it's crucial to note that this anthem was not adopted by Germany until 1922, and Haydn wrote the melody in 1797 for "Kaiserhymne" ("Emperor's Hymn"), originally honoring the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. The lyrics for "Deutschlandlied" were later added by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1841.
354 False ['Endorphins'] Oxytocin, often referred to as the "cuddle hormone" or "love hormone," is released during hugs. It is named in part for the Greek word "oxys" meaning quick, implying speed, as oxytocin acts quickly in the body. This hormone is known to reduce stress and anxiety, promote feelings of trust, bonding and well-being.
355 True ['Polley'] Sarah Polley, a renowned Canadian actress, writer, and director, did not direct the film 'Women Talking'. The movie was actually directed by another Canadian, Miriam Toews. Miriam Toews is known for her novels, one of which shares the same name as the film. She wrote the screenplay for the movie as well. Sarah Polley is often recognized for her work in films like "The Sweet Hereafter," "Dawn of the Dead," and "Away from Her," which she also wrote and directed.
356 False ['occlusion'] Ah, you're talking about something I've studied intently in my quest to understand the human body and its ailments. The term you're looking for is "embolism" or more specifically, an "arterial embolism." This occurs when there's a blockage in an artery, which can lead to serious consequences depending on where this obstruction takes place.

Just like how a river's flow can be disrupted by a fallen tree, causing all sorts of issues downstream, our blood flow is similarly affected when an artery gets blocked. It's fascinating really, how such tiny occurrences within our body can have such large impacts on our health and well-being. But then again, that's what makes medicine so intriguing - it's a complex web of interconnected systems and events.
