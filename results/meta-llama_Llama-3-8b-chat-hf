0 False ['Bogart'] I think I can help you with that!

The Hollywood icon with a last name starting with "B" that is also a verb meaning to hog something is none other than Nicolas Cage, whose last name is Coppola. The verb "copp" means to take or seize something for oneself, often in a selfish or greedy manner, which is definitely not cool!

However, I must correct you that Nicolas Cage's last name is not actually "B", but rather "Cage".
1 True ['Fiji'] The answer is Fiji!
2 False ['Calder'] What a fascinating question! As an artist, you're pushing the boundaries of what we consider "art" and challenging our traditional notions of creativity. The idea that art must be static is a limiting one, and I love your suggestion that the next step in sculpture is motion.

In fact, there are already many examples of kinetic art, which incorporates movement and interaction to create a dynamic experience. Kinetic sculptures, for instance, use motors, gears, and other mechanisms to create a sense of movement and energy. Some artists even use technology, such as sensors and algorithms, to create interactive installations that respond to the viewer's presence.

But I think you're getting at something deeper. You're suggesting that art shouldn't just be a static representation of an idea or emotion, but rather an experience that engages the viewer on multiple levels. By incorporating motion, you're creating a sense of dynamism and energy that can be mesmerizing and thought-provoking.

This idea also speaks to the concept of "embodiment" in art, which is the idea that the viewer's body is an integral part of the artistic experience. By incorporating motion, you're encouraging the viewer to engage with the artwork in a more physical and intuitive way, which can be a powerful way to connect with the art.

So, I think you're onto something here. The next step in sculpture is indeed motion, and it's an exciting direction for art to take. It challenges our assumptions about what art can be and how it can be experienced, and it opens up new possibilities for creative expression.

What do you think about the role of technology in kinetic art? Do you see it as a tool to enhance the artistic experience, or do you think it can sometimes get in the way of the art itself?
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] A great question for all you Potterheads and alchemy enthusiasts out there!

In the Harry Potter series, Harry's attempt to turn metals into gold using a mysterious substance is indeed inspired by medieval alchemy. The substance you're referring to is called "Philosopher's Stone" or "Elixir of Life" in alchemy.

In medieval alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone was believed to be a magical substance that could transform base metals into gold and confer eternal life. Alchemists sought to create this substance through a process of spiritual transformation, often involving the combination of various substances, such as mercury, sulfur, and salt.

In the context of Harry Potter, the Philosopher's Stone is a powerful magical artifact that can grant eternal life and transform metals into gold. However, it's worth noting that J.K. Rowling's depiction of the Philosopher's Stone is a fictionalized version of the alchemical concept, rather than a direct representation of medieval alchemy.

In medieval alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone was often associated with the concept of "solve et coagula" (dissolve and coagulate), which referred to the process of breaking down and reassembling substances to achieve spiritual transformation. Alchemists believed that the Philosopher's Stone was the key to unlocking this process, allowing them to create the perfect balance of opposites and achieve spiritual enlightenment.

So, while Harry Potter's attempt to turn metals into gold using the Philosopher's Stone is certainly an exciting and imaginative concept, it's important to remember that it's a fictionalized representation of medieval alchemy rather than a direct reflection of the historical practice.
4 True ['Leontyne Price'] A great question for opera lovers!

The answer is Leontyne Price. Her self-titled debut album, "Leontyne Price", released in 1961, is commonly referred to as the "Blue Album" due to its distinctive blue cover art. The album features arias by Verdi, Puccini, and other composers, showcasing Price's powerful and expressive soprano voice.
5 True ['Space Station'] A great question about a classic sci-fi show!

Commander John Sheridan and the gang on "Babylon 5" lived on a space station called Babylon 5, which is a massive, five-mile-long (8 kilometers) space station located in neutral territory between Earth and the alien nations of the galaxy.

Babylon 5 is a diplomatic outpost, a hub of intergalactic politics, commerce, and culture, where humans and various alien species come together to negotiate, trade, and resolve conflicts. The station is home to a diverse population of humans and aliens, including the crew of the station, diplomats, traders, and travelers.

So, to answer your question, Commander Sheridan and the gang didn't live in a traditional "TV place" like a house or a city, but rather on a futuristic space station that serves as a hub of intergalactic activity.
6 True ['Tyler'] William Henry Harrison, the 9th President of the United States, and his running mate John Tyler both fought in the War of 1812.

Harrison was a brigadier general in the Ohio militia and led a force of 1,200 men in the Battle of the Thames in October 1813, where they defeated a combined force of British regulars and Native American warriors. This battle led to the death of the Native American leader Tecumseh, which weakened the Native American resistance in the region.

John Tyler, who later became the 10th President of the United States, was a captain in the Virginia militia and fought in the Battle of Longwoods in April 1813, where his unit was defeated by a British force.

So, both William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, the presidential ticket in the 1840 election, fought in the War of 1812.
7 True ['Elvis Costello'] The answer is Elvis Costello!
8 True ['Corinth'] The answer is Corinth. The Isthmus of Corinth is a narrow strip of land that connects the Peloponnese peninsula with the Greek mainland. It is also the site of the ancient city of Corinth, which was an important city in ancient Greece, and the modern city of Corinth, which was rebuilt after the destruction of the ancient city.

11 True ['Run Interference'] The idiom is "Run interference for someone".
12 True ['Virginia Woolf'] The woman's story you're referring to is "Kew Gardens" by Virginia Woolf, and it was indeed illustrated by her sister Vanessa Bell. "Kew Gardens" is a short story that was first published in 1919 and is considered one of Woolf's most famous and influential works. The story is a meditation on the nature of reality, time, and human perception, and it explores the inner lives of its characters as they walk through a London park.

Vanessa Bell, who was a painter and a member of the Bloomsbury Group, a circle of artists, writers, and intellectuals that included Woolf, E.M. Forster, and Lytton Strachey, among others, created the illustrations for the first edition of "Kew Gardens". The illustrations are a beautiful example of Bell's work, which often blended elements of modernism and traditional techniques to create unique and innovative designs.

The Bloomsbury Group was a key part of the modernist movement in the early 20th century, and both Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell were important figures in the group. Woolf's writing and Bell's art often explored themes of identity, relationships, and the human experience, and their work continues to be celebrated and studied today.
13 True ['Fait Accompli'] I think I can help you with that!

The two-word situation you're referring to is likely "fait accompli," which is French for "done deed" or "accomplished fact." It's a common idiomatic expression that refers to a situation that has already been done or decided, and cannot be changed or undone.

In English, a similar phrase might be "fait accompli" or "a done deal," but the French phrase is more commonly used and has a more formal tone.
14 True ['Arsenic'] Before penicillin, salvarsan, a compound of arsenic, was used to treat syphilis. Salvarsan, also known as arsphenamine, was a synthetic compound developed in the early 20th century and was the first effective treatment for syphilis. It was introduced in 1910 and remained the primary treatment for syphilis until the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s.
15 True ['Jon Batiste'] I think you may be mistaken! There is no New Orleans pianist who won an Oscar and released a new album while keeping his day job as Stephen Colbert's bandleader in 2021.

However, I think you might be thinking of Jon Batiste, who is a New Orleans-born pianist and bandleader of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. He did win an Academy Award (Oscar) in 2022 for Best Original Score for the film "Souls of a Nation: Stories from the Frontlines of the Freedom Movement". He has also released several albums, including "We Are" in 2021.

Let me know if I'm correct!
16 True ['Customs'] A great question about space trivia!

When the Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, returned to Earth after their historic moon landing, they had to declare the Moon rocks they brought back to the United States Customs Service.

Yes, you read that correctly - the United States Customs Service! At the time, the Customs Service was responsible for regulating the importation of goods, including scientific samples, into the United States. The astronauts had to declare the Moon rocks as "scientific samples" and provide documentation about their origin, weight, and value.

This might seem unusual today, but it was a requirement under the Tariff Act of 1930, which governed the importation of goods into the United States. The Customs Service was responsible for ensuring that the Moon rocks were not being smuggled in or used for commercial gain.

After declaring the Moon rocks, the astronauts and their samples were cleared by Customs, and the rocks were then turned over to NASA for further study and analysis.
17 True ['O. Henry'] You're referring to the author of "The Gift of the Magi"!

The answer is O. Henry (William Sydney Porter). In 1898, O. Henry was indeed imprisoned for embezzlement of bank funds. He was convicted of stealing $3,500 from the First National Bank of Austin, Texas, where he worked as a cashier. He served three years in the Ohio Penitentiary before being released in 1901.

After his release, O. Henry moved to New York City, where he began writing short stories, including "The Gift of the Magi," which was published in 1906. Despite his troubled past, O. Henry went on to become one of the most beloved and celebrated American short story writers of all time.
18 True ['Byzantine'] During the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, mosaic was a major art form from the 4th to the 15th century, roughly from 300 to 1500 AD. This period is often referred to as the "Byzantine era" of mosaic art.

During this time, mosaics were used to adorn the walls, floors, and ceilings of churches, palaces, and other important buildings. The Byzantine Empire was known for its rich cultural heritage, and mosaic art played a significant role in its artistic expression.

Some notable examples of Byzantine mosaic art include:

1. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey, which features stunning mosaics depicting scenes from the Bible and the life of Christ.
2. The Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), which had a famous mosaic of the Twelve Apostles.
3. The mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy, which date back to the 6th century and are considered some of the finest examples of Byzantine mosaic art.

The Byzantine era of mosaic art is characterized by its use of small, colored tiles or pieces of glass, known as tesserae, to create intricate and detailed designs. The mosaics often featured biblical scenes, portraits of saints and emperors, and ornate patterns and designs.

The cornucopia, which you mentioned, is a symbol of abundance and fertility, and it was often depicted in Byzantine mosaics as a symbol of the emperor's power and wealth.
19 True ['Ethiopia'] What an intriguing question!

You're likely referring to Hubert Julian, also known as "The Black Eagle," who was a pioneering African American aviator and adventurer. In the 1930s, Julian did indeed go to fight for the Ethiopian Empire against Italian forces during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.

In 1935, Julian joined the Ethiopian Air Force, becoming the first African American pilot to fly combat missions. He flew a biplane, the Fokker F.VIIb/3m, and was known for his bravery and skill in the skies. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Julian and his fellow Ethiopian pilots managed to inflict significant damage on the Italian air force.

Julian's exploits in Ethiopia earned him international recognition, and he became a celebrated figure in the African American community. His remarkable story has been the subject of several books, films, and documentaries.

So, to answer your question, Hubert Julian went to fight for the Ethiopian Empire against Italy in the 1930s.

21 True ['Punjab'] Lahore is the second-largest city in Pakistan and the provincial capital of Punjab, which is a province located in eastern Pakistan.
22 False ['Sohpie Dahl'] The model-turned-author-actress who is the granddaughter of Patricia Neal is Tippi Hedren.
23 True ['The Goldfinch'] The answer is "The Goldfinch" by Donna Tartt.

In the novel, a bombing occurs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and a young boy named Theo Decker steals a small painting of a bird, "Carey's Bird", which becomes a central plot point in the story.

The novel was adapted into a film in 2019, directed by John Crowley and starring Ansel Elgort as Theo Decker.
24 True ['Daniel Defoe'] The answer is Daniel Defoe. The novel is titled "The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders" and was published in 1722.
25 False ['Extant'] What a fascinating question!

There are several artworks that start with the prefix "Ex-" and have survived the test of time. Here are a few examples:

1. **Exodus** (c. 2500 BCE): A ancient Egyptian wall painting depicting the Israelites' departure from Egypt, found in the tomb of Pharaoh Ramses VI.
2. **Exedra** (c. 2nd century CE): A marble sculpture of a reclining figure, attributed to the Greek sculptor Lysippos, now housed at the Vatican Museums.
3. **Ex-voto** (c. 15th century CE): A series of wooden panels depicting scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, created by the Italian artist Giotto, now preserved at the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi, Italy.
4. **Ex libris** (c. 15th century CE): A bookplate designed by the German artist Albrecht Dürer, featuring a portrait of the artist and his wife, now part of the collection at the British Library.
5. **Exquisite Corpse** (c. 1920s CE): A surrealist art movement that involved creating artworks by folding a paper in sections, with each artist contributing to the work without seeing what the previous artist had done. Several examples of Exquisite Corpse artworks are preserved in museums and private collections.

These are just a few examples of artworks that start with the prefix "Ex-" and have survived the centuries. There may be many more out there, waiting to be discovered and appreciated!
26 True ['Desperado'] The middle film of Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi trilogy is "Desperado" (1995), which is also the title of an Eagles hit song.
27 False ['Siamang'] I think you might be referring to the "Orangutan"!
28 False ['Abide With Me'] In the hymn or spiritual, "Fast falls the eventide" and "In life, in death, O Lord" are phrases that are often used to express a desire for comfort and guidance.

"Fast falls the eventide" is a phrase that means "the evening is falling quickly" or "night is falling rapidly". It is often used to express a sense of urgency or a feeling of being overwhelmed, and is often followed by a request for comfort or guidance.

"In life, in death, O Lord" is a phrase that is often used to express a desire for comfort and guidance in all aspects of life, including times of joy and times of sorrow. It is often used to express a sense of trust and dependence on God, and is often followed by a request for guidance or protection.

Here is an example of how these phrases might be used in a hymn or spiritual:

"Fast falls the eventide, and darkness gathers near
In life, in death, O Lord, be thou my comforter
Guide me through the shadows, and lead me to the light
And in thy presence, O Lord, I will take flight"

In this example, the phrases "Fast falls the eventide" and "In life, in death, O Lord" are used to express a desire for comfort and guidance in times of uncertainty and darkness. The hymn is asking God to be a source of comfort and guidance, and to lead the singer through the challenges of life.
29 True ['Tito'] The answer is Josip Broz Tito. He was the leader of Yugoslavia from 1945 until his death in 1980. He was known simply as "Tito" and did not live to see the collapse of Yugoslavia, which occurred in the early 1990s.
30 True ['Don Carlos', 'Don Carlo'] The title character in Verdi's opera "Don Carlo" is the son of King Philip II of Spain.
31 True ['Humboldt'] In the Galapagos Islands, the Garúa season is indeed named after a cold current, and it's named after the German scientist Eduard Garúa. The Garúa current is a cold Humboldt Current that brings nutrient-rich waters to the Galapagos Islands, which in turn supports the unique and diverse marine ecosystem of the archipelago. During the Garúa season, which typically occurs from June to November, the waters around the Galapagos are cooler and more nutrient-rich, leading to an increase in marine life and a change in the behavior of many species.
32 True ['Alphabet City'] You're referring to the legendary Alphabet City!

The neighborhood that runs through Avenues A, B, C, and D in Manhattan's East Village is indeed known as Alphabet City. This area has a rich history of artistic and cultural significance, and many artists have called it home over the years.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Alphabet City was a hub for the city's counterculture movement, with artists, musicians, and writers flocking to the area to take advantage of its affordable rent and vibrant atmosphere. The neighborhood was home to many iconic music venues, including CBGB, which was a launching pad for punk rock and new wave music.

Today, Alphabet City remains a popular destination for artists, musicians, and creatives, with a mix of galleries, studios, and performance spaces. The neighborhood's eclectic mix of old and new, from historic tenement buildings to trendy bars and restaurants, continues to inspire and attract artists from around the world.

According to the official results, the "Man" you're referring to is Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate. His total votes in Florida were indeed 97,488.
35 True ['Jill Scott'] A great question!

The answer is: Jill Scott (singer) and Ian Rankin (author) are NOT involved in the series.

The correct answer is: Jill Scott (actress) and Alexander McCall Smith (author).

Jill Scott played the lead role of Precious Ramotswe, the founder of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, in the 2009 film adaptation of the book series.

Alexander McCall Smith is the author of the book series, which follows the adventures of Precious Ramotswe, a traditional detective agency in Botswana, and her assistant, Mma Makutsi.
36 True ['Constantine'] There is no historical record of an event where Heaven came to Earth in the form of a crucifix in the sky labeled "By this symbol you will conquer" for any emperor in 312 A.D. or any other time.

However, it's possible that you may be referring to the story of Constantine the Great, who was the Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 A.D. According to legend, Constantine had a vision of a cross with the words "In hoc signo vinces" (Latin for "In this sign you will conquer") before the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 A.D. This vision is said to have inspired Constantine to convert to Christianity and use the Christian cross as a symbol of his army.

Constantine's victory at the Battle of Milvian Bridge led to the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire, and he went on to become one of the most important figures in the history of Christianity. However, there is no record of a crucifix appearing in the sky labeled with the words "By this symbol you will conquer" specifically for Constantine or any other emperor.
37 True ['Ardern'] There is no 42-year-old Prime Minister of New Zealand. The current Prime Minister of New Zealand is Jacinda Ardern, who was born on July 26, 1980, which would make her 43 years old in 2023. She has not made any surprise announcement about leaving the job.
38 True ['Fossa'] A fun question!

I think I have the answer: a Fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea)!

In the animated movie Madagascar, the fossa is depicted as a terrifying predator that chases after the main characters, including King Julian the lemur. However, in real life, fossas are actually solitary, carnivorous mammals that are native to Madagascar, and they do not typically prey on lemurs.

In fact, fossas are known to be relatively shy and elusive animals, and they tend to avoid confrontations with larger animals, including lemurs. So, it's unlikely that a fossa would be seen as terrifying to lemurs in real life, unlike its animated counterpart in Madagascar!

Did I get it right?
39 False ['Ensconced'] I think I can help you with that!

The word you're thinking of is "anchored". A light fixture can be anchored to a ceiling or wall, meaning it's securely fastened and won't be moving around.
40 False ['The Power of the Dog'] I think there may be some misinformation here!

To the best of my knowledge, there is no 2021 western film that features anthrax being weaponized against Benedict Cumberbatch. Anthrax is a serious bacterial infection that can affect animals, including cows, but it is not typically used as a weapon in films or real life.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a British actor known for his roles in films like "Sherlock," "Doctor Strange," and "The Imitation Game," among others. While he has appeared in a wide range of films, I'm not aware of any western film that features him being targeted with anthrax.

If you could provide more context or clarify which film you're thinking of, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
41 True ['The Turn of the Screw'] Peter Quint is a ghost plaguing the children in Benjamin Britten's opera "The Turn of the Screw", which is based on Henry James' novella of the same name.
42 False ['Night Vale'] I think there may be some confusion here!

Will Wheaton is an American actor, writer, and producer, best known for his roles in TV shows like "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "The Big Bang Theory". However, I couldn't find any information about him playing a chef at a restaurant called Tourniquet on a podcast called "Welcome to What Strange Town Where Stranger Things Happen".

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different actor or a fictional show/movie. Could you provide more context or clarify what you're referring to? I'd be happy to help you investigate further!

The poem you're thinking of is "In a Station of the Metro" by Ezra Pound. The full poem is:

"The apparition of these faces in the crowd:
Petals on a wet, black bough."

The poem was first published in 1913 and is considered one of Pound's most famous works.
46 True ["Harry's House"] The third solo pop music album by Harry Styles is titled "Harry's House".
47 False ['Eroica'] A clever riddle!

48 True ['Yemen'] The correct answer is "Yemen". The 2011 British comedy-drama film is titled "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen".
49 True ['Pillars of Hercules', 'Hercules'] The flag of Spain features the emblems of its historic kingdoms, but it does not feature pillars astride the Sea of Gibraltar.

The flag of Spain is a tricolor, consisting of three horizontal stripes of red, yellow, and red, with the national coat of arms in the center of the yellow stripe. The coat of arms features the emblems of the historic kingdoms of Castile, León, Aragon, and Navarre, as well as the Pillars of Hercules, which are the mythological pillars that are said to mark the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.

The Pillars of Hercules are not actually located astride the Sea of Gibraltar, but rather are depicted on the coat of arms as two stone pillars with a banner between them. The Pillars of Hercules are a symbol of the power and strength of Spain, and are often associated with the country's rich history and cultural heritage.
50 True ['Crohn'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer: The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) was founded in 1967, and the organization held a dance featuring Ella Fitzgerald to honor Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, a renowned gastroenterologist who first described Crohn's disease in 1932.

Dr. Crohn's work led to a better understanding of the disease, and his name is now part of the foundation's name, recognizing his contributions to the field of gastroenterology.

Am I correct?
51 True ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] I think I can help you with that!

In economics, the term starting with "U" that fits your description is likely "Upcycle". Upcycling refers to the process of transforming or reusing old or discarded materials to create a new product of higher quality or value. This concept is often associated with sustainability and environmental consciousness.

The term "Upcycle" is often used in contrast to "Downcycle", which refers to the process of breaking down or degrading materials to their original state or a lower level of quality.

As for the second part of your question, I'm assuming you're referring to the concept of "Green" in the context of sustainability and environmentalism. In this context, "Green" often refers to the use of environmentally friendly practices, products, and technologies that minimize harm to the environment and promote sustainability.

So, to summarize, the term starting with "U" that fits your description is indeed "Upcycle", and the concept of "Green" refers to environmentally friendly practices and products.
52 True ['Lisbon'] King Carlos I of Portugal and his son, Luis Filipe, were assassinated on February 1, 1908, in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.
53 False ['Jubjub'] A delightful reference to Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky"!

The phrase "Beware the Jabberwock, My Son" is a famous opening line from the poem, which is known for its made-up words and nonsensical language.

As for the second part of your question, I think you might be referring to the "Borogove". In the poem, it is said that the Borogove is a creature that "belly-flopped in slumber on the river's grassy brink" and that it "repeats itself". The Borogove is indeed a fictional creature that is not found in any real-world ornithological books.
54 True ['Inigo Jones'] The answer is Inigo Jones (1573-1652). He is indeed considered England's first great architect and is credited with introducing classical architecture to England. He began work on The Queen's House in Greenwich, London in 1616, which is considered England's first classical building.
55 True ['Revolutionary Road'] The novel you're referring to is likely "Revolutionary Road" by Richard Yates. The title "Revolutionary Road" is a reference to the idea that the ideals and values of the American Revolution, which were born in 1776, had reached a dead end by the 1950s.

In the novel, the Wheelers, a suburban couple living in the 1950s, are struggling to find meaning and purpose in their lives. The title suggests that the revolutionary ideals of freedom, equality, and individualism that were central to the American Revolution had become stagnant and unfulfilling by the mid-20th century.

Yates' novel is a critique of the conformity and materialism of post-war American society, and the title "Revolutionary Road" is meant to evoke a sense of disillusionment and stagnation.
56 True ['medulla oblongata'] The lowest part of the brain stem is called the Medulla Oblongata.
57 True ['Kool Herc'] A hip-hop history question!

According to your hint, the answer is Kool Herc, who was the DJ at the party on August 11, 1973. Kool Herc's real name is Clive Campbell, and he adopted the stage name "Kool Herc" from Hercules, the mythical strongman.

So, the answer is Hercules!
58 False ['Cuspidor'] A clever anagram!

After some thought, I think I have the answer: "Spittingly" anagrams to "Perfect Crisp Duo".

Am I correct?
59 True ['Giraffe'] I think I can help you with that!

The amble is indeed a type of gait used by okapis, which is a giraffe-like animal native to the Congo.

As for your second question, I believe you are referring to a "trot". A trot is a type of gait where both legs on the same side of the body move at the same time. This is a common gait used by many animals, including horses, donkeys, and mules.
60 True ['Wesley'] The answer is John Wesley! John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, has an American university named for him: John Wesley University, located in High Point, North Carolina.
61 True ['Perdition'] Tom Hanks starred in the 2002 film "The Road to Perdition", not "The Road". In the movie, Tom Hanks played the role of Michael Sullivan, a father who embarks on a journey with his son to find his youngest son, who has been kidnapped by a gangster. The title "Road to Perdition" refers to the journey that the characters take, which is fraught with danger and uncertainty, and ultimately leads to a sense of loss and tragedy.
62 True ['Muir'] The national monument in Marin County known for old growth redwoods is named after Muir Woods National Monument, which is named after John Muir, a famous conservationist and naturalist.

64 True ['bluebonnet'] The Texas trail you're referring to is likely the Bluebonnet Trail, which is named after the state flower of Texas, the bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis). The Bluebonnet Trail is a popular route that takes you through the rolling hills and countryside of Texas, where you can see the beautiful bluebonnets blooming in the spring.
65 True ['Norway'] Jens Stoltenberg, the Prime Minister of Norway, placed rice as the inaugural deposit in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.
66 True ['Pacific'] On May 18, 1942, the cover of Time Magazine featured Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet.
67 False ['Third Rock from the Sun'] I think you might be referring to the TV sitcom "3rd Rock from the Sun"!

The show aired from 1996 to 2001 and starred John Lithgow, Kristen Johnston, French Stewart, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a family of aliens from the planet Rutherford, who are sent to Earth to observe human behavior and report back to their leader, Dick Solomon (played by John Lithgow).

The Solomon family, which includes Dick, Sally (Kristen Johnston), Tommy (French Stewart), and Harry (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), get into all sorts of wacky misadventures as they try to understand human culture and navigate everyday life on Earth.

Is that the show you were thinking of?
68 True ['Tuvalu'] The former Ellice Islands are now the country of Tuvalu. Tuvalu derives a substantial part of its revenue from leasing the .tv domain name.
69 True ['Trepanning', 'trepanation', 'trephination', 'trephining'] You're referring to a rather... interesting medical practice from the past!

The procedure you're thinking of is called "trephining" or "craniotomy." It was an ancient surgical technique used to relieve pressure on the brain, often believed to be caused by evil spirits or demons. The procedure involved drilling a hole into the skull to release the supposed evil spirits or to relieve pressure on the brain.

Trephining has been practiced by various cultures around the world, including ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Native Americans, dating back to around 7000 BCE. The procedure was often performed to treat conditions such as headaches, seizures, and mental illness, which were sometimes attributed to the presence of evil spirits or demons.

In modern medicine, trephining is no longer a common practice, and more effective and evidence-based treatments have replaced it. However, the concept of trephining has been studied by historians and anthropologists to understand the cultural and medical practices of ancient societies.
70 True ['Templar'] You're referring to a significant event in medieval history!

In 1310, many Templars (Knights Templar) were tried in Paris for heresy and later burned at the stake. The Knights Templar was a Christian military order founded in the 12th century, known for their military prowess and their role in defending the Holy Land during the Crusades.

The trials were initiated by King Philip IV of France, who was deeply in debt to the Templars and resented their power and influence. The King, with the support of Pope Clement V, accused the Templars of heresy, blasphemy, and sodomy, and ordered their arrest and imprisonment.

The trials, which took place in Paris and other locations in France, were marked by torture, forced confessions, and a lack of due process. Many Templars were found guilty and sentenced to death by burning at the stake. Estimates vary, but it's believed that between 54 and 138 Templars were executed in France between 1310 and 1314.

The most famous of these trials was that of Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the Templars, who was burned at the stake in Paris on March 18, 1314. De Molay's execution was particularly dramatic, as he allegedly cursed King Philip IV and Pope Clement V before his death, leading to a long-standing legend about the curse of the Templars.

The persecution of the Templars was a significant event in European history, marking the beginning of the end of the Order and leading to the suppression of other military orders and the rise of the Inquisition.
71 False ['Coulis'] What a delightful question!

I think I have the answer: Compote ends with the silent consonant "T".

And, as you mentioned, a compote is a sauce made by slow-cooking fruit in syrup, then pureeing and straining it to create a smooth, flavorful sauce.

Am I correct?
72 True ['William Faulkner'] The American novelist who created the Compson brothers Benjy, Quentin, and Jason is William Faulkner. The Compson brothers are main characters in Faulkner's novel "The Sound and the Fury", published in 1929.
73 True ['Pinniped'] The mammalian group that includes seals, sea lions, and walruses is called Pinnipedia, which comes from the Latin words "pinna," meaning "fin" or "wing," and "ped," meaning "foot."
74 True ['Narita'] You're welcome!

The answer is Narita Airport (NRT). The Narita Express (N'EX) is a high-speed train that connects Tokyo Station to Narita International Airport, which is located about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Tokyo.
75 True ['Martinique'] Fort-de-France is the capital of Martinique, which is an overseas department and region of France located in the Caribbean.
76 True ['Dierks Bentley'] The country song "Drunk on a Plane" is performed by Dierks Bentley, whose initials are indeed "D.B.".
77 True ['Olympus'] What a thrilling idea! As a fitfluencer, I'd love to take on the challenge of climbing the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars!

Olympus Mons is a massive shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of Mars, and it's truly a behemoth. With a height of approximately 27 km (17 miles) above the Martian surface and a base diameter of over 600 km (373 miles), it's not only the largest volcano in the solar system but also one of the largest mountains in the solar system.

As a fitfluencer, I'd be excited to tackle this incredible challenge and share my journey with my followers. Just imagine the breathtaking views from the summit, the sense of accomplishment, and the opportunity to inspire others to push their limits and explore the unknown.

Of course, there are some logistical challenges to consider. Olympus Mons is a massive volcano, and the Martian terrain is quite unforgiving. The atmosphere is thin, and the temperatures can drop to -125°C (-193°F) at night. Not to mention the lack of breathable air, which would require specialized equipment and a reliable oxygen supply.

But, as a fitfluencer, I'm all about embracing challenges and finding creative solutions. With the right gear, training, and support team, I'm confident that I could make it to the summit of Olympus Mons and share my incredible journey with the world.

Who knows, maybe one day, I'll be the first fitfluencer to conquer Olympus Mons and inspire a new generation of Martian adventurers!
78 True ['Groundlings'] A great question about the Globe Theatre!

In Shakespeare's time, the Globe Theatre had a unique seating arrangement, with different price tiers for different areas of the theatre. The "pit" referred to the open area in front of the stage, where the groundlings stood to watch the play.

The groundlings, also known as "pitmen," were the cheapest ticket holders. They paid a penny to stand in the pit and watch the play. Yes, you read that right - just one penny!

The groundlings were a lively and enthusiastic crowd, often participating in the performance by shouting out lines, making comments, and even influencing the action on stage. They were a key part of the Globe's atmosphere and helped to create a sense of community and shared experience.

So, if you were part of the groundlings, you would have paid the lowest amount to stand in the pit and watch a play at the Globe Theatre - just one penny!
79 False ['Austria'] The 1 Euro coin was not designed by Josef Kaiser. The 1 Euro coin is a denomination of the official currency of the Eurozone, the Euro (€). It was introduced in 2002 and features a common design on the obverse (front) side, which is the European Union's coat of arms. The reverse (back) side of the coin features a design specific to each member state, and is changed every 2-3 years.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different coin or currency. If you could provide more information or clarify your question, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
80 True ['November Rain'] I think I can help you with that!

The song "Nothing Lasts Forever" is actually the B-side to the single "Civil War" from Guns N' Roses' album "Use Your Illusion II". The lyrics don't specifically mention a month.

However, I think you might be thinking of the song "November Rain", which is a power ballad from the same album. The lyrics of "November Rain" do mention the month of November.
81 True ['Kerry'] The politician who wrote the memoir "Every Day is Extra" is John Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, 5-term United States Senator from Massachusetts, and former Secretary of State.
82 True ['Viviparous'] The word starting with "V" that has 10 letters and describes one who bears live young not from eggs is "Viviparous".
83 True ['Azerbaijan'] The correct answer is Azerbaijan. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is located at an elevation of approximately 92 feet (28 meters) below sea level, making it the lowest national capital in the world.
84 True ['Flubber'] The super bouncy stuff from Disney's 1961 movie "The Absent Minded Professor" is called "Flubber". The title of the 1997 remake is also "Flubber".
85 True ['Quiet Desperation'] In his book "Walden; or, Life in the Woods", Henry David Thoreau wrote:

"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

This famous quote is from the opening chapter of the book, and it's a commentary on the monotony and lack of fulfillment that many people experience in their daily lives.
86 True ['Marlow'] You're thinking of the iconic character from Joseph Conrad's novella "Heart of Darkness"!

The character you're referring to is Marlow, a sailor who travels up the Congo River into the heart of Africa in search of the infamous ivory trader, Kurtz. As he journeys deeper into the jungle, Marlow encounters various tribes and witnesses the brutal effects of colonialism and imperialism.

It is during his journey that Marlow hears about "the horror" - the atrocities committed by Kurtz, who has become a god-like figure to the local tribes. Marlow is deeply disturbed by what he learns and begins to question the values and morality of Western civilization.

The novella is a classic critique of colonialism and the darkness that lies at the heart of human nature.
87 True ['Gallium'] I think there may be some misinformation here!

The T-1000, a fictional robot from the Terminator franchise, is known for its ability to shape-shift and change its form. However, it's not based on a real-world material or element.

Gallium (symbol Ga) is a metal with a relatively low melting point of 29.76°C (85.57°F), which is often used in various applications such as electronics, semiconductors, and thermometers. However, it's not capable of shape-shifting like the T-1000.

In reality, shape-shifting materials are still largely the realm of science fiction, although researchers have been exploring the development of materials with unique properties, such as:

1. Shape-memory alloys (SMAs): These alloys can change shape in response to temperature changes and then return to their original shape when heated or cooled.
2. Hydrogels: These soft, gel-like materials can change shape in response to changes in temperature, pH, or other environmental factors.
3. Liquid-metal alloys: These alloys can change shape and flow like a liquid, but still retain some of their solid properties.

While these materials have impressive properties, they are still far from achieving the level of shape-shifting capabilities depicted in science fiction, including the T-1000.

So, to summarize, gallium (Ga) is a metal with a low melting point, but it's not the basis for a shape-shifting robot like the T-1000.
88 True ['Fancy Free'] What a great question!

The answer is "Fancy Free"! Jerome Robbins choreographed "Fancy Free" in 1944, and it's a ballet about three sailors on leave in New York City, searching for romance and adventure. The ballet premiered on April 18, 1944, at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City.

"Fancy Free" is indeed the ballet that ends with the word "ree", and it's a classic of American ballet. The music is by Leonard Bernstein, and the ballet is based on a story by Jerome Robbins and librettist Arthur Laurents.

So, to answer your question, "Fancy Free" is the ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins and ending with 'ree' that's about 3 footloose sailors "On The Town"!
89 True ['Justinian'] The 6th century outbreak of Bubonic Plague that bears the name of a Byzantine Emperor is the Plague of Justinian. It occurred during the reign of Emperor Justinian I (527-565 CE) and is considered one of the most devastating pandemics in human history.

The Plague of Justinian is believed to have started in 541 CE and lasted for several years, killing an estimated 25 million people, which was approximately 10% of the world's population at the time. The plague had a significant impact on the Byzantine Empire, weakening its economy and military, and contributing to the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Justinian himself was severely affected by the plague, and it is believed that he may have contracted the disease in 541 CE. He survived the initial outbreak but suffered from recurring bouts of the disease throughout his reign. Despite his illness, Justinian continued to rule the empire, and his reign is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Byzantium due to his efforts to rebuild and strengthen the empire.
90 True ['Pensacola'] The Spanish expedition you're referring to is likely the one led by Tristán de Luna y Arellano, who established a settlement at Pensacola, Florida in 1559. The settlement was known as Villa de San Miguel de Gualdape, and it was located on the western end of the Florida Panhandle, near the present-day city of Pensacola.

The settlement was established on September 23, 1559, and it was intended to be a base for further Spanish exploration and colonization of the region. However, the settlement was plagued by a series of misfortunes, including a hurricane that destroyed much of the settlement, and a lack of supplies and support from Spain. As a result, the settlement was abandoned in 1561, and it was not until the 1690s that the Spanish returned to the area and established a new settlement at Pensacola.
91 True ['Avogadro'] The Italian scientist who formulated this law is Amadeo Avogadro, not an Italian law. Avogadro's Law states that:

"At constant temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain an equal number of molecules."

This law was first proposed by Avogadro in 1811 and is a fundamental principle in chemistry and physics. It is often referred to as Avogadro's Hypothesis or Avogadro's Principle.
92 True ['Tequila'] The answer is "Tequila"!
93 True ['August Strindberg'] The answer is August Strindberg. His collection of stories, "Married", was published in 1884 and was considered scandalous and blasphemous by many in Sweden at the time. Strindberg was a Swedish playwright, novelist, and painter, and his work was often provocative and challenging to the social norms of his time.
94 True ['Freebooter'] A clever question, matey!

I think I have the answer: "Freebooter"! A freebooter is a pirate who operates outside the law, plundering and pillaging without permission or allegiance to any particular nation or authority. The term "free" in this context means "unrestricted" or "unbound", rather than "cost-free".

So, a "Freebooter" shoe would likely be a rugged, adventurous, and perhaps a bit rebellious footwear option, perfect for a swashbuckling pirate on the high seas!
95 True ['Bhutan'] The correct answer is Bhutan.
96 True ['Moravia'] The three regions mentioned in the preamble to the Czech Constitution are:

1. Bohemia (Čechy)
2. Moravia (Morava)
3. Silesia (Slezsko)

So, the correct answer is Moravia.
97 True ['Ampere', 'Ampère'] The base unit of electrical current is named after André-Marie Ampère, a French mathematician and physicist. His initials are A.M.A.
98 True ['Sphynx'] The hairless breed of cat you're referring to is the Sphynx. The Sphynx breed was developed in Canada in the 1960s and 1970s, and it's said to have originated with a kitten named Prune.

Prune was a hairless kitten born in 1966 to a domestic cat named Elizabeth, who was owned by a breeder named Mrs. B. Corbeil in Toronto, Canada. Corbeil was fascinated by Prune's unique appearance and decided to breed her to see if she could reproduce the hairless trait.

Over the years, Corbeil worked with other breeders to develop the Sphynx breed, and in 2002, the breed was officially recognized by the International Cat Association (TICA). Today, the Sphynx is a popular breed around the world, known for its sleek, wrinkled skin and affectionate personality.
99 True ['Vorpal Sword'] I think there may be some confusion here!

In Tim Burton's 2010 film "Alice in Wonderland", Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska) does not slay the Jabberwocky. In fact, the Jabberwocky is not even a character in the film.

The Jabberwocky is a fictional creature from Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky", which is a part of his 1871 novel "Through the Looking-Glass". In the poem, the protagonist slays the Jabberwocky with a vorpal sword.

The phrase "Callooh! Callay!" is also from the poem, and is the protagonist's triumphant cry after slaying the Jabberwocky.

So, to summarize, Alice does not slay the Jabberwocky in Tim Burton's film, and the phrase "Callooh! Callay!" is not from the film either.
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome is credited with the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, which he completed around 405 AD. The Latin Vulgate is considered one of the most influential and widely used translations of the Bible in the Western Christian tradition.

The "middle 'G'" you're referring to is likely the Latin word "Graeca", which means "Greek". The Latin Vulgate is a translation of the Greek Septuagint (LXX) and the original Greek texts of the New Testament, into Latin.
101 True ['Eisenhower'] The president who increased the minimum wage to $1 was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He signed the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) on June 25, 1938, which established the minimum wage at $0.25 per hour, effective October 24, 1938. The minimum wage was then increased to $0.75 per hour on September 3, 1945, and finally to $1.00 per hour on September 3, 1950.

The president who approved and opened the St. Lawrence Seaway was Dwight D. Eisenhower. The St. Lawrence Seaway is a system of locks and canals that connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, allowing for the passage of ships between the two bodies of water. The seaway was a joint project between the United States and Canada, and it was officially opened on June 26, 1959.
102 True ['Bret Easton Ellis'] The novel "Less Than Zero" is written by Bret Easton Ellis.
103 True ['Kent'] The white cliffs of Dover are located in Kent, England.
104 False ['Florence Pugh'] Toby Sebastian is the brother of Daisy Edgar-Jones, who starred in the 2022 film "Don't Worry Darling" alongside Harry Styles.
105 False ['Ha Ha'] You're referring to the infamous "ha-ha"!

A "ha-ha" is a type of sunk fence or ditch that was popular in 18th-century England and was often used to separate animal from human territory, particularly on estates and country homes. The idea was to create a barrier that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional, allowing animals to roam freely while keeping them from entering the human living areas.

And, yes, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, his iconic home in Virginia, did have a ha-ha! In fact, it was a prominent feature of the estate's design, separating the lawn and gardens from the surrounding woods and fields. The ha-ha at Monticello was designed to be both functional and beautiful, with a serpentine shape that followed the natural contours of the land.

The name "ha-ha" is thought to have originated from the sound of laughter or surprise that people would experience when they first saw the unexpected drop-off or ditch. It's a clever and whimsical name that adds to the charm of this unique architectural feature!

So, the next time you're strolling through a beautiful estate or country home, keep an eye out for the ha-ha – it might just bring a smile to your face!
106 True ['Venerate'] The word starting with "V" that is from Latin for "Love" and means to regard with devotion or reverence is "Venerate".
107 True ['Flagella', 'Flagellum', 'Flagellin'] The parts of the bacterial cell that provide motility are flagella (singular: flagellum). Flagella are long, whip-like structures that protrude from the cell surface and allow the bacterium to move through its environment. They are typically longer than cilia, which are shorter, hair-like structures found in some eukaryotic cells.

In bacteria, flagella are responsible for swimming, gliding, or twitching movements, depending on the type of movement and the bacterial species. Flagella are powered by the rotation of a protein called flagellin, which is driven by the energy generated from the breakdown of nutrients.

There are several types of flagella found in bacteria, including:

1. Monotrichous flagella: A single flagellum that is found at one end of the cell.
2. Lophotrichous flagella: A cluster of flagella that are found at one end of the cell.
3. Amphitrichous flagella: Flagella that are found at both ends of the cell.
4. Peritrichous flagella: Flagella that are found all over the surface of the cell.

Flagella play a crucial role in the survival and success of many bacterial species, allowing them to move towards nutrients, escape predators, and colonize new environments.
108 True ['Bill Hodges'] That's correct! "Finders Keepers" is the second book in the Bill Hodges trilogy by Stephen King, and it follows the events of the first book, "Mr. Mercedes". The third and final book in the trilogy is "End of Watch".
109 True ['Manila'] John Basilone, a Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant, was nicknamed "Manila John" due to his service in the Philippines in the 1930s.
110 True ['Io'] The Juno spacecraft did not take an infrared shot of a moon of Jupiter aglow with volcanoes in 2022. Juno is a NASA spacecraft that has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, and its primary mission is to study the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior.

However, the spacecraft has taken many stunning images of Jupiter's atmosphere and magnetic field, as well as its moons. In 2022, Juno captured a stunning image of Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. The image shows Io's surface glowing with volcanic activity, with bright orange and yellow colors indicating the presence of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.

Io is the innermost of the four largest moons of Jupiter, known as the Galilean moons, and is the only moon in the solar system with active volcanoes. The volcanoes on Io are fueled by Jupiter's gravitational pull, which generates internal heat and tides that flex the moon's crust, causing volcanic activity.

Juno's image of Io was taken on February 25, 2022, and was released by NASA on March 3, 2022. The image was taken at a distance of about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) above Io's surface and has a resolution of about 15 miles (24 kilometers) per pixel.
111 True ['NewsRadio'] Phil Hartman played the role of Bill McNeal on the 1990s sitcom "NewsRadio".
112 False ['hermeneutics'] The answer is Exegeses.
113 True ['Pascal'] The Frenchman you're referring to is Blaise Pascal, and he indeed invented a mechanical adding machine in 1642. Pascal's machine, known as the Pascaline, was a mechanical calculator that could perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. It was the first practical mechanical calculator and paved the way for the development of more advanced calculators and computers.

The Pascaline was a significant innovation in mathematics and engineering, and it's still celebrated today as a milestone in the history of computing. In fact, the Pascal programming language, developed in the 1970s, was named after Blaise Pascal in recognition of his contributions to the field of computer science.
114 True ['Colleen Hoover'] The woman author you are referring to is Colleen Hoover. Her books "It Ends with Us", "It Starts with Us", and "All Your Perfects" (not "Heart Bones", which is a different book) took the top three spots on the New York Times paperback trade fiction list.
115 True ['Rhode Island'] I think there may be some confusion here!

St. Mary's Church near Hammersmith Farm is actually located in Newport, Rhode Island, USA. This is where Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, later Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, were married on September 12, 1953.

Hammersmith Farm is a historic estate in Newport, Rhode Island, and St. Mary's Church is a beautiful Catholic church located nearby. The wedding was a private ceremony, and the reception was held at Hammersmith Farm.

So, to answer your question, Jackie and JFK were married in the state of Rhode Island, USA!
116 True ['Stalingrad'] The Nazis' advance into Russia was stopped at Stalingrad (now Volgograd), where two of their armies, the 6th Army and the 4th Panzer Army, surrendered on February 2, 1943. This marked a major turning point in the war on the Eastern Front and is considered one of the most significant battles of World War II.
117 False ['Karma Chameleon'] I think I can help you with that!

The song you're thinking of is probably "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" by Tight Fit, which was a hit single in 1981. The lyrics "You come and go, you come and go" are indeed from that song.
118 True ['Hagiography'] The word ending with 'Y' that has come to mean an admiring or idealized chronicle of anyone is Hagiography.

Hagiography is the writing of the lives of saints or other religious figures, often with a focus on their virtues and miracles. Over time, the term has also been used more broadly to describe any admiring or idealized biography or account of someone's life.
119 True ['Potsdam'] The city is Potsdam. Potsdam was a residence of the Elector of Brandenburg and later became the site of the Potsdam Conference in August 1945, where the leaders of the three main Allied powers (the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union) met to discuss post-war reorganization and the occupation of Germany.
120 True ['Francis Bacon'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer:

The 17th century Essayist who was the Lord Chancellor of England with the same first and last name as the 20th Century Painter of 'Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)' is:

Francis Bacon!

Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was an English philosopher, statesman, and essayist who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1618 to 1621. He is known for his philosophical works, particularly his essays, which are considered some of the most influential in the English language.

Francis Bacon (1909-1992) was a British painter who was known for his portraits and still-life paintings. His painting "Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)" is a notable work, and it's interesting to note that the two Francis Bacons share the same name, although they lived in different centuries and worked in different fields!

Please let me know if this answer is correct!
121 False ['Calypso'] What a fascinating question!

The answer is Nausicaa, a nymph who shares her name with a music style. In Homer's Odyssey, Nausicaa is the daughter of King Alcinous and Queen Arete of the Phaeacians. She is the one who welcomes Odysseus, the legendary hero, when he washes up on the shores of her kingdom.

Angelica Kauffmann, a Swiss-Italian neoclassical painter, depicted Nausicaa welcoming Odysseus in her painting "Nausicaa Welcoming Odysseus" (c. 1780). The painting is a beautiful representation of the scene from Book 6 of the Odyssey, where Nausicaa, accompanied by her maids, finds Odysseus on the beach and shows him hospitality.

The music style "Nausicaa" is actually a type of waltz, named after the nymph. It was popularized in the 19th century and is characterized by its lively, elegant, and slightly exotic rhythm.

So, to summarize: Nausicaa, the nymph, is the subject of both the Odyssey and the painting by Angelica Kauffmann, and also the name of a music style, a waltz.
122 True ['The Thing'] That's an easy one!

The movie you're thinking of is "The Thing" (1982), directed by John Carpenter. The shape-shifting alien, known as "the Thing," is a parasitic creature that can assimilate and perfectly imitate any living being, including humans. Kurt Russell plays the role of R.J. MacReady, a helicopter pilot and leader of a research team in Antarctica.

The movie is a classic sci-fi horror film that explores themes of paranoia, isolation, and the fear of the unknown. It's known for its tense atmosphere, practical effects, and iconic score.

So, to answer your question, the movie set in Antarctica with a shape-shifting alien that menaces helicopter pilot Kurt Russell is indeed "The Thing" (1982)!
123 False ['Sir James Dewar'] A classic!

The comic verse you're referring to is likely a quote from the character Sir James in the play "The Importance of Being Earnest" by Oscar Wilde. The full quote is:

"Sir James: Who is a better man than you are, none of you asses ever knew your father!"

This quote is often shortened to the version you provided:

"Sir James: Who is a better man than you are/None of you asses/Can liquefy gases"

The quote is a humorous example of Sir James's eccentricity and wit, and is often used to illustrate his absurd and playful nature.
124 False ['Cold Open'] You're thinking of the iconic opening of Saturday Night Live!

The answer is: "Live from"

The show's opening scene typically features a sketch that takes place in a fictional setting, often with a news desk or a stage, and the words "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night Live!" are displayed on screen.
125 True ['Tom Jones'] A fun question!

The answer is Tom Jones! Tom Jones, a Welsh singer and a legend in his own right, appeared as a guest judge on The Voice UK in 2012. During the show, he was paired with contestant Jaz Ellington, and they performed a duet of James Brown's classic hit "It's a Man's Man's Man's World". Jennifer Hudson, a guest coach on the show at the time, joined them on stage for an impromptu performance. The unplanned duet was a huge hit, and it's still remembered fondly by fans of the show.
126 True ['Windward'] A geography question!

The passage between Hispaniola (which is shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and Cuba is called the Windward Passage.

And, further southeast, you'll find the Bahamas, which are a group of islands with the same name.
127 True ['Butler'] The female author whose novel "Kindred" tells the story of Dana, a young black woman who is transported from the 1970s back in time to the pre-Civil War South is Octavia Butler.

"Kindred" is a science fiction novel published in 1979, and it is considered one of Butler's most famous works. The novel explores themes of time travel, slavery, and the experiences of African Americans during the pre-Civil War era.
128 False ['peristaltic', 'peristalsis'] Not quite!

Heartburn during pregnancy is actually caused by several factors, but the slowing down of digestion is not one of them.

During pregnancy, the hormone progesterone increases significantly, which can cause the muscles in the digestive tract to relax, including the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The LES is a ring-like muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach. When it relaxes, stomach acid can flow back up into the esophagus, causing heartburn and acid reflux.

Additionally, the growing uterus can put pressure on the stomach, causing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus. This pressure can also cause the stomach to become more acidic, which can exacerbate heartburn symptoms.

Other factors that can contribute to heartburn during pregnancy include:

* Hormonal changes: Progesterone can slow down digestion, but it's not the primary cause of heartburn.
* Increased blood volume: This can increase blood flow to the stomach, which can lead to increased acid production and heartburn.
* Relaxation of the LES: As mentioned earlier, the hormone progesterone can cause the LES to relax, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus.

To manage heartburn during pregnancy, it's essential to eat small, frequent meals, avoid trigger foods, and elevate the head of your bed by 6-8 inches to reduce acid reflux at night. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult your healthcare provider for further guidance.
129 True ['The Unbearable Lightness of Being'] The novel by Milan Kundera that features Tereza's love for Tomas, who also has a mistress named Sabina, is "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" (1984).
130 False ['endoskeleton'] A 12-letter long or longer word for the internal supporting structure of vertebrates is "vertebral column".
131 True ['Luminosity'] What a clever question!

After some astronomical sleuthing, I think I've found the answer:

The anagram "Mutiny Oils" can be rearranged to spell out "Luminosity", which is indeed a term that refers to a star's brightness!

Well done on creating a clever anagram, and I hope this answer shines brightly for you!
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] BRMC stands for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, a rock band from San Francisco, California. The band's name is indeed inspired by the Marlon Brando character, Johnny Strabler, and his motorcycle gang in the 1953 film "The Wild One".
133 True ['Yellen'] I think I can take a guess!

You're likely referring to Janet Yellen, the former Chair of the Federal Reserve (2014-2018) and the first woman to hold the position. She was also a key economic advisor to President Barack Obama.

So, I'm giving a high 5 to Janet Yellen!
134 True ['Auricle'] A clever question!

The answer is: Auricles.

In animals, the outer, visible parts of the ears are called auricles. And, interestingly, the auricles of the heart (also known as the auriculae) get their name due to their resemblance to the auricles of the ear. The auricles of the heart are the upper chambers that receive blood returning to the heart, and their shape is said to resemble the shape of an animal's ear.
135 False ['Josef K'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I'm going to take a guess that the character you're thinking of is Holden Caulfield from J.D. Salinger's classic novel "The Catcher in the Rye".

Here's why:

* "Arrested development" is a fitting description of Holden's character, as he's struggling to transition from adolescence to adulthood.
* "Legal issues" might refer to the fact that Holden is expelled from several prestigious boarding schools due to his rebellious behavior and poor grades.
* "A letter-perfect life no more at 31" is a clever reference to the fact that Holden's idealized view of the world, which he had at 16, has been shattered by his experiences and disillusionments.
* Finally, the "Kafka-Esque" aspect might be due to the themes of alienation, anxiety, and the search for meaning that are characteristic of both Holden's story and Kafka's works.

Am I correct?
136 True ['Animorphs'] I think I can help you with that!

The book series you're referring to is likely "Animorphs" by K.A. Applegate. The series was published from 1996 to 2000 and follows a group of teenagers who discover a way to shapeshift into various animals, known as "Animorphs," to fight against an alien invasion.

The series was incredibly popular in the 1990s and has since become a cult classic. It's known for its blend of science fiction, action, and coming-of-age themes, as well as its memorable characters and epic battles.

141 True ['Formosa'] What a fascinating piece of history!

George Psalmanazar, a French-born adventurer, indeed claimed to be from Taiwan, which was then known as Formosa. He arrived in London in 1703 and gained fame by presenting himself as a native of Formosa, a claim that was widely believed by the British public at the time. He even wrote a book about his supposed experiences in Formosa, which was published in 1704.

However, it was later discovered that Psalmanazar was actually from France, and his entire story was a fabrication. Despite this, his book remains an important work in the field of anthropology and has been studied by scholars for its insights into 18th-century European perceptions of the Far East.

I think I have the answer: Wool!

Wool is a type of fabric made from the natural fibers of sheep and other animals, and it's often used to make suits, pleated skirts, and other garments. The word "wool" can sound a bit "bad" when pronounced with a strong emphasis on the "W" sound, but it's a high-quality and popular fabric nonetheless!
145 True ['Boole'] The English mathematician you are referring to is George Boole. He was born on November 2, 1815, in Lincoln, England. Boole is known for his work in the fields of mathematics, logic, and philosophy, and his contributions to the development of algebraic logic.

Some of the eponymous concepts and terms that are associated with Boole include:

* Boolean algebra: a system of algebraic operations that is used to represent logical operations and is the foundation of modern digital electronics.
* Boolean logic: a system of logic that is based on the use of Boolean algebra and is used to represent and manipulate logical statements.
* Boolean operators: a set of logical operators that are used to combine Boolean expressions and are used in Boolean algebra and Boolean logic.
* Boolean search: a type of search that uses Boolean logic and Boolean operators to search for specific terms or phrases in a database or on the internet.

Boole's work in these areas has had a significant impact on the development of computer science and has led to the creation of many modern technologies, including digital computers and the internet.

It was his first play in over 20 years and was inspired by his experiences as the President of the Czech Republic from 1989 to 1992.

154 True ['Axolotl'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer: Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum).

The Axolotl is a type of salamander that is native to Mexico, and its name comes from the Nahuatl language, which was spoken by the Aztecs. In Nahuatl, "Axolotl" is written as "āxōlōtl", which means "water monster" or "water dog".

This quote emphasizes the idea that knowledge and understanding are powerful tools that can be used to shape the world and achieve great things.
158 True ['Suva'] The capital of Fiji with 4 letters that is home to the University of the South Pacific is SUVA.
159 True ['Monsanto'] Roundup, also known as glyphosate, was first developed and marketed by Monsanto, a biotechnology company that was later acquired by Bayer in 2018. Monsanto introduced Roundup in the 1970s, and it quickly became one of the most widely used herbicides in the world.

In the 1990s, Monsanto began developing genetically modified crops that were resistant to glyphosate, allowing farmers to spray the herbicide directly on their crops without harming them. These crops, known as "Roundup Ready" crops, were first introduced in the late 1990s and have since become widely adopted in many parts of the world.

The first genetically modified crop to be approved for commercial use was the Roundup Ready soybean, which was approved by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1996. Since then, many other crops, including corn, cotton, and canola, have been genetically modified to be resistant to glyphosate.
160 True ['Rothaniel'] The answer is "Rothaniel". Jerrod Carmichael's 2022 stand-up special is titled "Rothaniel", and in it, he reveals secrets, including his first name, which is Rothaniel.

163 True ['Ming'] The Chinese dynasty that ruled from 1368 to 1644 and imported blue pigment from Prussia for its porcelain is the Ming dynasty.
164 False ['Leguizamo'] I think I can help you with that!

The Latino actor you're referring to is Benicio del Toro. He starred in "Summer of Sam" (1999) and "Spawn" (2002). Additionally, he voiced the character of Bruno in the Disney animated film "Encanto" (2021).

As for not talking about it, I'm assuming you're referring to the fact that Benicio del Toro's voice acting work in "Encanto" might not be as widely known or discussed as his live-action film roles.
165 True ['Thorazine', 'Chlorpromazine'] There is no Ben Kingsley in the movie "Shutter Island" (2010). The character Teddy Daniels is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.

In 1954, the FDA approved the anti-psychotic medication Thorazine (chlorpromazine).
166 True ['Jungian'] The type of analysis you're referring to is Jungian analysis, named after Carl Jung, a famous Swiss psychiatrist. The anima is a key concept in Jungian psychology, which is a school of thought that emphasizes the importance of the unconscious mind and the integration of opposites.

In Jungian theory, the anima is the feminine aspect of a man's personality, which is often repressed or hidden from conscious awareness. The anima is seen as a symbol of the feminine principle, and is often associated with qualities such as receptivity, nurturing, and emotional depth.

Jung believed that the anima is an essential part of a man's psyche, and that it plays a crucial role in his emotional and spiritual development. He believed that the anima is often projected onto women, and that men must integrate their anima in order to achieve wholeness and individuation.

Jung's concept of the anima is closely related to his concept of the collective unconscious, which is a shared reservoir of archetypes and images that are common to all humans. The anima is seen as a part of the collective unconscious, and is often symbolized in dreams, myths, and fairy tales.

Overall, the anima is a central concept in Jungian analysis, and is seen as a key to understanding the complexities of the human psyche.
167 True ['Giorgione'] The answer is Giorgione, whose name means "Big George" in Italian. Giorgione was a Venetian painter who was active in the early 16th century and is considered one of the most important artists of the Venetian Renaissance.
168 False ['Wisconsin'] Samuel's Cave is not a real location, and therefore, it does not exist in any state's La Crosse County. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different cave or location.

170 True ['linear accelerator'] The 2-mile-long linac in Menlo Park, CA is part of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, which is a linear accelerator, or linac, that is used to accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light.

SLAC stands for Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and it is a national laboratory that is operated by Stanford University and the Department of Energy. The laboratory is home to a number of advanced particle accelerators, including the 2-mile-long linac that you mentioned.

The linac at SLAC is used to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light, which allows scientists to study the properties of matter at the atomic and subatomic level. The linac is used in a variety of experiments, including the study of the structure of atoms and molecules, the behavior of subatomic particles, and the properties of materials at the nanoscale.

Some of the specific experiments that have been conducted at SLAC include the study of the structure of DNA, the behavior of quarks and gluons, and the properties of superconducting materials. The laboratory is also home to a number of other advanced facilities, including a synchrotron light source and a free-electron laser.

Overall, the linac at SLAC is an important tool for scientists who are working to understand the fundamental nature of matter and the universe.
171 True ['Criminal Minds'] Mr. Scratch is a villain who first appeared in Season 10 of the CBS series "Criminal Minds", which is set at the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (B.A.U.).
172 True ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] What a delightful Italian phrase!

The English equivalent of "a caval donato non si guarda in bocca" is indeed "you ungrateful thing" or "you're ungrateful, to say the least." However, I'd like to provide a more nuanced translation to better capture the idiomatic essence of the phrase.

The phrase "a caval donato non si guarda in bocca" literally means "one doesn't look in the mouth of a given horse" (caval = horse, donato = given, non si guarda = one doesn't look, in bocca = in the mouth). This idiomatic expression is used to convey that when someone receives a favor or a gift, they should be grateful and not question the motivations or quality of the gift. It's a reminder to appreciate the kindness and not be overly critical or ungrateful.

In English, a more idiomatic translation could be:

* "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
* "Don't question the motives behind a gift."
* "Be grateful for what you receive."
* "Don't be ungrateful or critical of a kindness."

These phrases convey the same idea as the original Italian expression, emphasizing the importance of gratitude and appreciation for the favors and gifts we receive.
173 False ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 1926 Balfour Report brought about the "Jewish Agency" which was described as "equal in status, in no way subordinate to each other" with the Zionist Organization.
174 True ['William Blake'] The visionary English artist and poet whose work is featured in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" from 1790 is William Blake.
175 True ['Han'] The Moonlight Rainbow Fountain in Seoul, South Korea is indeed the world's largest bridge fountain, stretching 3,740 feet (1,140 meters) in length. And, it's powered by recycled water from the Han River, which runs below the bridge.
176 True ['Finnish'] I think I can help you with that!

The European language that comes to mind with double vowels like "Tuli" for fire and "Tuuli" for wind is Finnish!

In Finnish, it's common to have double vowels, such as "aa", "ee", "ii", "oo", and "uu", which can change the pronunciation and meaning of words. For example, "tuli" indeed means "fire", and "tuuli" means "wind".

Is that correct?
177 True ['Prometheus'] I think I can help you out!

You're likely referring to the Titan Prometheus, who defied Zeus by stealing fire from the gods and giving it to humanity. According to Greek mythology, Prometheus was chained to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains by Zeus as punishment for his actions.

The phrase "it was lit" is a modern slang expression that means something was exciting or wild, but in this context, it's a clever play on words to reference the fiery passion and defiance of Prometheus.

As for the phrase "Zeus cuffed him to that mountain," it's a clever way of referencing the mythological story where Zeus chained Prometheus to the rock as punishment. The phrase "cuffed" is a modern slang term that means to restrain or confine someone, which fits perfectly with the mythological context.

So, to summarize, it was lit when Prometheus hung with mankind and defied Zeus, but it got real dark after Zeus cuffed him to that mountain as punishment!
178 True ['plethora'] The Greek word for "fullness" is "plethōra". The 8-letter word that can mean an overabundance is "PLETHORA".
179 True ['As you Like It'] The Shakespeare speech that contains the line "My Brother Jaques He keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit" is from Act 2, Scene 7 of the play "As You Like It".

The Oort Cloud is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first proposed its existence in the 1950s.
181 True ['Croesus'] A clever question!

The answer is: "Croesus!"

In the 1696 play, the character is likely referring to the ancient Lydian king Croesus, who was proverbially wealthy and known for his vast riches. The phrase "rolling in it" is a metaphorical expression that means being extremely wealthy, and Croesus is the classic example of someone who was "rolling in it."
182 True ['Germanicus'] The answer is Germanicus. Germanicus was a Roman general and politician who was the brother of Claudius and the father of Caligula. He campaigned near the Rhine, leading successful military campaigns against the Germanic tribes, but he got his name "Germanicus" not from his campaigns in Germany, but rather because he was adopted by Nero Claudius Drusus, who was known as Germanicus.
183 True ['Parallax'] A clever question!

The answer is "parallax" and "second". A parsec is a unit of length that is equal to about 3.26 light-years, and it is derived from the concept of parallax, which is the apparent shift of a nearby star's position against the background of more distant stars when viewed from opposite sides of the Earth's orbit. The "second" part of the name refers to the fact that the unit is based on the measurement of the angle of parallax in seconds of arc.
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] What a fascinating crossover question!

I'm going to take a stab at it. Based on my knowledge, I think the answer is:

Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) takes on Ellen Ripley (Alien) from the movie "Aliens" (1986), played by Sigourney Weaver.

And, if I'm correct, the Robin Williams woman who enjoys a cake moisturizer is likely to be Vivian Ward, the character played by Julia Roberts in the movie "Pretty Woman" (1990).

Am I correct?
185 False ['Library Paste'] A blast from the past!

I think you're referring to "PVA" (Polyvinyl Acetate), also known as white glue or school glue. It's a common adhesive used in bookbinding, paper crafting, and other applications where a strong, flexible bond is needed.

PVA is a water-based adhesive that dries clear and is relatively non-toxic. It's often used to attach paper, cardstock, or other lightweight materials together, and it's also used to repair tears or holes in paper.

In the context of bookbinding, PVA is often used to attach endpapers to the book block, to attach the book cover to the book block, or to repair damaged pages or spines.

So, to answer your question, the "L.P" you're referring to is likely PVA, the thick white adhesive commonly used in bookbinding and other applications!
186 True ['Rime of the Ancient Mariner'] I think I can help you with that!

The poem you're referring to is likely "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, not Samuel Coleridge. The poem is a classic of English literature, and it's known for its unique structure and imagery.

The stanza you're talking about is likely the following:

"Ah! cruel Fate, that I should come
To this vile World, from that fair Home!
The Steersman lies asleep, or wakes
To watch the single Star that breaks
The horizon's rim; and, as he stands,
The dead men give a groan.
Heaven and Hell and the Sea and Stars
And Darkness and the silent deep
Are all asleep."

This stanza is indeed an exception to the usual 4-line stanza structure of the poem, and it's a pivotal moment in the narrative. The Steersman is a key figure in the poem, and his sleepiness or wakefulness has significant consequences for the Mariner and the ship's crew.
187 False ['Montserrat'] The answer is Saint Lucia. Christopher Columbus named the island "Isla de Cuervas" in 1493, and it was later claimed by the French in 1638. The British took control of the island in 1783, and it has remained a British territory ever since.
188 True ['The Commitments'] The answer is "The Commitments".
189 True ['101'] A classic story!

According to legend, Carl Friedrich Gauss, a young student at the time, was tasked by his teacher to add up the first 100 positive integers. Instead of adding each number individually, Gauss quickly noticed that he could pair up the numbers in a clever way to simplify the calculation.

Here's how he did it:

Gauss paired up the numbers as follows:

1 + 100 = 101
2 + 99 = 101
3 + 98 = 101
...
49 + 51 = 100
50 + 50 = 100

Notice that each pair adds up to 101, except for the last pair, which adds up to 100. Since there are 50 pairs, the total sum is:

50 × 101 = 5050

Adding the remaining 100 (from the last pair), we get:

5050 + 100 = 5150

So, the sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5150.

This story is often cited as an example of Gauss's exceptional mathematical abilities and his ability to think creatively and find innovative solutions to problems.
190 True ['Io'] A mythological question!

You're likely thinking of Io, a mortal woman who was loved by Zeus. According to Greek mythology, Zeus fell in love with Io and transformed her into a cow to hide her from his wife, Hera, who was jealous of Zeus' infidelity.

As a cow, Io was driven mad by the gadfly sent by Hera and wandered the earth, eventually being discovered by Hermes and brought to Egypt, where she was restored to her human form.
191 True ['Kim'] The plot you're describing sounds like the story of Kim, a novel by Rudyard Kipling. Kimball O'Hara, the protagonist, is an Irish orphan who grows up on the streets of Lahore, India, and becomes a spy for the British Secret Service in the late 19th century.
192 False ['Rum Runner'] A classic piece of American folklore!

Bill McCoy was a bootlegger during Prohibition in the United States, and his reputation for quality control earned him the nickname "The Real McCoy." He was known for his high-quality, untaxed whiskey, which was smuggled into the United States from Canada and the Caribbean. McCoy's whiskey was said to be of exceptional quality, and his reputation for consistency and purity made him a popular choice among those seeking a good drink during the Prohibition era.

The phrase "The Real McCoy" eventually became a colloquialism for something that is genuine, authentic, or of high quality.
193 True ['Iron Chancellor'] Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Germany from 1871 to 1890, was nicknamed "Iron Chancellor" (Eiserne Kanzler). The nickname "Iron" refers to his strong and unyielding leadership style, as well as his ability to navigate complex political situations and make tough decisions.
194 True ['Hamilton'] The documentary "Riding Giants" (2004) features Laird Hamilton, a professional surfer who is married to volleyball player Gabrielle Reece.

He has dressed the feet of many celebrities and fashion icons over the years, and his shoes have been featured in numerous films, including Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette'.
197 True ['Aruba'] The colorful Dutch Colonial style building you're referring to is likely the Fort Zoutman Historical Museum, which is located in Oranjestad, the capital of Aruba, a small island in the southern Caribbean that is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
198 False ['Solarization'] The photographic effect that is 12 letters long and reverses tones and introduces highlights to images is called "INVERSES".
199 False ['Bartleby'] A clever question!

I think I have the answer: "Billy Budd" by Herman Melville.

In the novel, Billy Budd, a young sailor, is falsely accused of mutiny and is imprisoned. The character you're referring to is probably John Claggart, the master-at-arms, who initially notices Billy's innocent nature and is drawn to him, but ultimately becomes obsessed with destroying him. Claggart's obsession leads to Billy's imprisonment and ultimately, his tragic fate.

Am I correct?
200 True ['Quincy Jones'] I think there may be some misinformation here!

It was actually Harry Nilsson, not Donald Trump, who had a brain aneurysm in 1973. Nilsson was an American singer-songwriter and musician, best known for his hit songs "Everybody's Talkin'" and "Without You".

After his aneurysm, Nilsson did not produce songs like "We Are the World". "We Are the World" was a charity single recorded by a supergroup of popular artists, including Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, and many others, in 1985 to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The song was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, and produced by Quincy Jones.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, is a businessman and politician who has never been known for his music career. He has been the 45th President of the United States since 2017.
201 True ['Tikrit'] Saddam Hussein was born near the city of Tikrit, which is located on the west bank of the Tigris River in Iraq.
202 True ['Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'] Benjamin Walker played the role of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, in the 2012 movie "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter".
203 True ['Jemison'] I'm happy to help! However, I must correct you - Nichelle Nichols' character, Lieutenant Uhura, was not an astronaut or a space traveler in the Star Trek franchise. She was a communications officer on the USS Enterprise.

As for your question, there has not been a first African-American woman in space yet. While there have been several African-American astronauts who have flown in space, including Mae Jemison, who became the first African-American woman in space in 1992, she was not the first. Jemison flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-47) in September 1992.

It's worth noting that there have been several African-American astronauts who have flown in space, including:

* Guion Bluford, who became the first African-American in space in 1983
* Ronald McNair, who flew on the Space Shuttle Challenger (STS-41B) in 1984
* Frederick Gregory, who flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-51B) in 1985
* Mae Jemison, who flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-47) in 1992
* Winston Scott, who flew on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-72) in 1996
* Bernard Harris, who flew on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-55) in 1993
* Stephanie Wilson, who flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-121) in 2006
* Robert Curbeam, who flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-116) in 2006
* Joan Higginbotham, who flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-116) in 2006

These individuals have made significant contributions to the field of space exploration and have paved the way for future generations of astronauts.
204 True ['Belshazzar'] According to the book of Daniel, the son of Nebuchadnezzar who was killed during the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C. was Belshazzar.
205 True ['Martin McDonagh'] The playwright who saw the opening night of The Cripple of Inishmaan is Martin McDonagh, and he has recently made a movie with a similar title, "The Banshees of Inisherin".
206 True ['Mohs'] A very specific question!

According to the Mohs hardness scale, talc has a hardness of 1. The Mohs hardness scale is a scale used to measure the scratch resistance of a material, with 1 being the softest and 10 being the hardest.

Here's the Mohs hardness scale:

1. Talc
2. Gypsum
3. Calcite
4. Fluorite
5. Apatite
6. Orthoclase (feldspar)
7. Quartz
8. Topaz
9. Corundum (ruby, sapphire)
10. Diamond

So, talc is indeed at the bottom of the scale, with a hardness of 1.
207 True ['White Noise'] The rock band The Airborne Toxic Event did not get its name from a Don DeLillo novel that became a movie in 2022. The band's name actually comes from a passage in Don DeLillo's 1982 novel "White Noise".

In the novel, the term "airborne toxic event" refers to a chemical spill that releases a toxic substance into the air, causing widespread panic and chaos. The band's lead singer, Mikel Jollett, has said that he was inspired by the phrase and its sense of urgency and danger, and decided to use it as the name for his band.

There was no movie adaptation of "White Noise" in 2022. However, a film adaptation of the novel, directed by Noah Baumbach and starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig, was released in 2022.
208 False ['Karnak'] The temple complex on the right bank of the Nile that occupies part of the site of the ruins of ancient Thebes is the Temple of Edfu.
209 True ['Dan Rostenkowski'] A sports and politics question!

Bill Romanowski, a former NFL linebacker, did indeed play for the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, and Denver Broncos.

Now, regarding the Illinois politician who went from power in the U.S. House to prison in the 1990s...

I believe you're referring to Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat who represented Illinois's 5th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1953 to 1995. Rostenkowski was a powerful figure in the House, serving as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1981 to 1993.

However, in 1994, Rostenkowski was convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy related to his use of congressional stationery and staff for personal gain. He was sentenced to 17 months in prison, fined $100,000, and ordered to pay restitution.

So, to answer your question, Dan Rostenkowski is the Illinois politician who went from power in the U.S. House to prison in the 1990s.
210 False ['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'] I think there may be some misinformation here!

Mario Vargas Llosa is a Peruvian writer and politician, and he has never given a Nobel laureate a literal black eye. In fact, Vargas Llosa himself was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010.

It's possible that you're thinking of a different incident or a fictional event. Could you provide more context or clarify what you're referring to? I'd be happy to help you investigate further!
211 True ['Kepler'] When Tycho Brahe died in 1601, his protege, Johannes Kepler, succeeded him as the Imperial Mathematician.
212 True ['Philip Glass'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I found that the composer who created "A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close" is Philip Glass. And, indeed, Chuck Close painted a portrait of Philip Glass, titled "Phil" (1985).

Philip Glass is an American composer known for his minimalist style, and Chuck Close is a renowned American painter and photographer. The portrait "Phil" is a great example of their collaboration and mutual admiration.

So, to answer your question: Philip Glass created "A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close", and Chuck Close painted "Phil", a portrait of Philip Glass!
213 False ['Dangerous Liaisons'] The Starz prequel TV show that depicts the younger Marquise De Merteuil and Vicomte De Valmont from a novel of romantic intrigue is "Belleville" (2021).
214 True ['polyglot'] The 8-letter word starting with "P" that means a speaker of many languages is "polyglot".
215 True ['China'] The Misty Poets, also known as the "Misty School" or "Misty Generation", were a group of Chinese poets who emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. They were a key part of the Chinese literary scene during the Cultural Revolution.

The Misty Poets were a group of avant-garde poets who rejected the traditional forms and themes of Chinese poetry, instead embracing more experimental and personal styles. They were known for their use of imagery, symbolism, and free verse, which was a departure from the more formal and structured poetry that was typical of Chinese literature at the time.

Some of the most famous Misty Poets include:

* Du Fu (1923-2000)
* Gu Cheng (1956-1993)
* Bei Dao (1949-present)
* Yang Lian (1955-present)
* Shu Ting (1952-present)

The Misty Poets were a key part of the cultural and literary movement in China during the 1960s and 1970s, and their work was often seen as a challenge to the official Communist Party line. Many of the Misty Poets were persecuted or forced to flee China during the Cultural Revolution, but their work has had a lasting impact on Chinese literature and culture.
216 True ['Wings'] What a great combination of questions!

The story of WWI pilots is a thrilling one, and I'd be happy to spin a yarn for you. Imagine it: the year is 1918, and the skies are filled with biplanes, their propellers whirring as they engage in dogfights above the trenches of France. You're a young pilot, fresh out of flight school, and you're about to embark on a series of daring missions with your squadron.

As you soar through the clouds, you feel the rush of adrenaline as you take on the enemy, your plane shaking and rattling with every burst of machine gun fire. You're a hero, a true aviator, and you know that every flight could be your last.

Now, about that war film that won the first Best Picture Oscar...

The answer is "Wings" (1927), a silent film directed by William A. Wellman and starring Clara Bow, Charles "Buddy" Rogers, and Richard Arlen. The movie tells the story of two young men who join the United States Army Air Service during World War I and become pilots. The film follows their adventures, including a romantic subplot, as they face the dangers of war in the skies.

"Wings" was a groundbreaking film in many ways. It was the first feature-length film to be shot entirely in the United States, and it was also the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, which it did at the 1st Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. The film's success helped establish the aviation genre in Hollywood, paving the way for future classics like "The Blue Max" (1966) and "Top Gun" (1986).

I hope you enjoyed this brief tale of WWI pilots and the first Best Picture Oscar winner!
217 True ['Bearer Bond', 'Bearer Bonds'] In banking, "B.B." stands for "Bearer Bond" or "Bearer Security". These are securities, such as bonds or notes, that are payable to the person who holds the physical certificate, regardless of who the registered owner is. In other words, the security is transferable by mere possession, without the need for endorsement or registration.

Bearer bonds are typically issued in bearer form, which means that the owner's name is not recorded on a register. Instead, the bond is payable to the person who presents the certificate, as long as it is in good condition and has not been tampered with.

Bearer bonds are relatively rare today, as most securities are issued in registered form, which requires the owner's name to be recorded on a register. However, some older bonds or securities may still be issued in bearer form.
218 False ['Superannuated'] The synonym for "Obsolete" that is from Latin for literally "Over one year old" is "Antiquus".

Antiquus is a Latin word that means "old" or "ancient", and it is indeed literally translated as "Over one year old".
219 True ['V.S. Naipaul'] I think there may be a mistake here!

V.S. Naipaul, a Trinidad-born author, did win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, but not for "A House for Mr. Biswas". "A House for Mr. Biswas" is actually a novel written by Naipaul, published in 1961. It's one of his most famous works.

Naipaul won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001 "for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories".

So, to correct your question: V.S. Naipaul, the Trinidad-born author, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, but not for "A House for Mr. Biswas", which is one of his notable works.
220 True ['Eris'] The dwarf planet named after the Greek goddess of strife is Eris. It was discovered in 2005 and is comparable in size to Pluto.
221 True ['Bismarck'] The Admiralty Islands were under German control from about 1885 to 1914, along with the rest of the Bismarck Archipelago, which is located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Papua New Guinea.

223 True ['Topkapi'] The correct answer is Topkapi Palace.
224 False ['Murmansk'] The Russian port with unrestricted access to the Atlantic and the largest city north of the Arctic Circle is Arkhangelsk. Arkhangelsk is a major port city located on the Northern Dvina River, which flows into the White Sea, which in turn connects to the Atlantic Ocean via the Barents Sea. The city has a population of around 350,000 people and is an important center for trade, industry, and transportation in the region.
225 False ['The Triplets of Belleville', 'Les Triplettes de Belleville'] I think I can help you with that!

The title trio of sisters you're referring to are the "Sisterhood" from the 2003 French film "Les Sœurs Grimm" (also known as "The Three Sisters" or "Grimm Sisters"). The film is a musical drama that tells the story of three sisters who help rescue a kidnapped cyclist.

The sisters, played by Émilie Dequenne, Olivia Bonamy, and Isabelle Carré, are all musically talented and use their skills to help the cyclist, who is a friend of theirs, escape from his captors.

Is that the correct answer?
226 True ['Zanzibar'] A fascinating piece of history!

You're referring to the brief reign of Sultan Khalid bin Bargash of Zanzibar, which lasted from August 27 to August 29, 1896. During this time, he declared Zanzibar's independence from Britain and launched a war against the British Empire.

The island in question is Unguja, also known as Zanzibar Island, which is the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, located off the coast of Tanzania.
227 True ['Luanda'] The answer is Luanda.
228 True ['Oliver Cromwell'] The Lord Protector who reportedly said that the execution of Charles I was "Cruel Necessity" was Oliver Cromwell.
229 False ['Allocution'] The answer is "Oratio".
230 True ['Lester Bangs'] The critic who wrote a book about Blondie is Lester Bangs, and "Let It Blurt: The Life and Times of Lester Bangs, Loose Lensman, Righteous Rocker, Vicious Villain" is a biography about him.
231 False ['Elmore Leonard Nimoy'] What a fascinating question!

I believe the answer is Elmore Leonard, the renowned American novelist and screenwriter, known for his gritty and witty writing style. He wrote the novel "Get Shorty", which was adapted into a film in 1995.

And, if I'm not mistaken, Leonard is also the author who wrote the foreword to the book "The Making of Star Trek" (1980), where he famously asked readers to "Live Long and Prosper" - a nod to the iconic Vulcan salute popularized by the Star Trek franchise.

So, to answer your question, the name joined with Elmore Leonard is Leonard himself!
232 True ['Cyrus the Great'] I think there may be some misinformation here!

The Jews were actually released from captivity in Babylon by the Persian king Cyrus the Great, not a "Great" Persian. Cyrus the Great was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire and is considered one of the most important figures in Jewish history.

In 539 BCE, Cyrus conquered Babylon and freed the Jews from their exile, allowing them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple. This event is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Ezra and the book of Isaiah.

Cyrus's decree, known as the Cyrus Cylinder, is considered one of the earliest examples of a royal decree that allowed a group of people to return to their homeland and rebuild their temple. The cylinder is now housed in the Iranian National Museum in Tehran.

So, to answer your question, it's Cyrus the Great, not a "Great" Persian, who is credited with releasing the Jews from captivity in Babylon!
233 True ['Prince Albert'] You're referring to the charming and stylish Prince Albert II of Monaco!

Yes, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II is the reigning monarch of the Principality of Monaco, having ascended to the throne in 2005 upon the death of his father, Prince Rainier III. He is also the Marquis of Baux, a title that has been held by the Grimaldi family since the 13th century.

As the Prince of Monaco, he is the head of state and the symbol of national unity, and he plays an active role in promoting the country's interests and well-being. He is also known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in the areas of environmental conservation, education, and healthcare.

And, as you mentioned, he's often referred to as a "Man about Town" due to his dashing good looks, charming personality, and high-profile social life. He's been spotted at numerous high-society events, including royal weddings, charity galas, and Formula One racing events (Monaco is, after all, famous for its Grand Prix).

So, there you have it! Prince Albert II of Monaco: a true prince of style, sophistication, and influence.
234 True ['Aye-Aye'] What a fascinating question!

The rare lemur you're referring to is the Aye-Aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis). It's a type of long-fingered lemur found only in Madagascar. The Aye-Aye is known for its unusual appearance, which includes:

* A pointed snout, often described as resembling a possum's face
* Large, prominent teeth that are similar to those of a rat
* Large, triangular ears that are similar to those of a bat

The Aye-Aye is also known for its long, thin fingers and toes, which it uses to catch insects, grubs, and even small vertebrates. Its unusual appearance and behavior have led to its reputation as a "spooky" or "cursed" animal in local folklore.

So, there you have it! The Aye-Aye is the rare lemur with the face of a possum, the teeth of a rat, and the ears of a bat.
235 False ['Downtrodden'] I think there may be some confusion here!

The poem "The New Colossus" was actually written by Emma Lazarus, not Paul Auster. It was written in 1883 and is engraved on a plaque inside the Statue of Liberty.

The poem is a sonnet that speaks to the idea of the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of hope and freedom for immigrants coming to the United States. The poem specifically addresses the idea of the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" and the "wretched refuse" of the world who are seeking a better life.

So, to answer your question, the type of people that Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus" is addressing are immigrants, particularly those who are seeking refuge and a better life in the United States.
236 True ['For Your Eyes Only'] The collection of short stories you're referring to is "For Your Eyes Only" by Ian Fleming.
237 True ['Dawn Treader'] Lord Drinian is the captain of the Narnian ship called the "Lion of Narnia" in "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" by C.S. Lewis.
238 False ['Cats Cradle'] The book is "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut.
239 False ['Coho'] That's a clever question!

I think I can help you out. The word you're looking for is "whisky". It contains the letters "his" which are a part of the word "silver salmon" (although not literally inside, but rather a clever play on words!).
240 False ['Calla'] I think I can help you with that!

The two-word colorful flowers that are a type of Lily are... Tiger Lilies!
241 False ['Bubba Ho-Tep'] A classic quote!

The movie starting with "B" is "Beverly Hills Cop III" (1994), starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley.
242 True ['Isle of Wight'] Queen Victoria had a vacation residence on the Isle of Wight, which is an island off the coast of southern England. The Isle of Wight is a ceremonial county, but it is not a part of any other administrative county. It has its own county council and is a separate administrative entity.
243 True ['Formaldehyde'] The embalming agent you're referring to is formaldehyde. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), many of the thousands of uncapped oil wells in the United States, particularly those in the Gulf Coast region, are leaking methane and other pollutants, including formaldehyde.

Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen and is commonly used as an embalming agent in the funeral industry. However, it's also a byproduct of the natural gas production process, and it can be released into the environment through leaks and venting from oil and gas wells.

The EPA has identified formaldehyde as one of the many pollutants that can be released from uncapped oil wells, along with methane, benzene, and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants can have serious health and environmental impacts, including increased risk of cancer, respiratory problems, and climate change.

The issue of uncapped oil wells is a significant environmental concern, particularly in areas like the Gulf Coast, where the oil and gas industry has a long history of operations. The EPA and other regulatory agencies have been working to address the issue, but it remains a complex and challenging problem to solve.
244 False ['Berkshires'] The correct answer is the Williamstown Theatre Festival, which is held in Williamstown, Massachusetts.
245 False ['Ceres'] The only dwarf planet that orbits the Sun closer than Neptune is Eris. Eris has a semi-major axis of about 37.8 astronomical units (AU), which is slightly closer to the Sun than Neptune's semi-major axis of about 30.1 AU.
246 False ['Arthur Ashe'] The quote "The night I met Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in the summer of 1975, I went to bed and slept soundly" is said by Kate in the novel "Days of Grace" by Graham Swift.
247 True ['Rhone', 'Rhône'] The answer is the Rhône River. The Rhône River originates in the Swiss Alps, near Lake Geneva, and flows approximately 500 miles (800 km) to the Mediterranean Sea, where it empties into the Gulf of Lion near the city of Marseilles (Marseille) in France.
248 True ['todo el mundo'] The word or phrase you are referring to is "todo el mundo". This is a common way to say "everybody" in Spanish, and it literally translates to "all the world".

However, it's worth noting that in Spanish, the more common way to say "everybody" is simply "todos" (masculine) or "todas" (feminine), which is a more direct translation of the English word.

"Todo el mundo" is more often used in phrases like "todo el mundo está hablando de esto" (everyone is talking about this), where it's used to emphasize that the topic is of interest to a wide audience, rather than just a specific group of people.
249 True ['John Singer Sargent'] The three-named painter who created the official White House portrait of Teddy Roosevelt is John Singer Sargent.
250 True ['Pump and Dump', 'Pump Dump', 'Pumping and Dumping', 'Pumping Dumping', 'pump-and-dump'] You're referring to a classic example of a pump and dump scheme!

A pump and dump scheme is a type of fraudulent investing scheme where an individual or group artificially inflates the price of a stock by spreading false or misleading information about the company, its products, or its financial performance. This creates a false sense of urgency and excitement among investors, causing the stock price to rise.

Once the price has been artificially inflated, the perpetrators sell their shares at the higher price, making a profit. Meanwhile, the stock price inevitably drops when the truth about the company's financials or products becomes public, leaving unsuspecting investors with significant losses.

Pump and dump schemes often involve spreading false information through social media, online forums, or other channels to create a sense of hype and excitement around the stock. This can include fake news articles, fake analyst reports, or even fake celebrity endorsements.

It's important to note that pump and dump schemes are illegal and can result in serious legal consequences for those involved. If you're considering investing in a stock, it's essential to do your own research, be cautious of unsolicited investment advice, and always verify information through reputable sources before making a decision.
251 True ['Dalí', 'Dali'] A fascinating question!

In his autobiography "My Last Sigh", Luis Buñuel mentions the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí, who was known for his eccentric behavior and surrealistic art. According to Buñuel, Dalí would often seduce women and then place fried eggs on their shoulders as a form of "artistic" expression.

This anecdote has become a famous and enduring example of Dalí's eccentricity and Buñuel's witty storytelling.
252 True ['baptism'] According to Luke 3:21-22, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River when he was about 30 years old. This event is often referred to as Jesus' baptism or his "baptism of repentance."
253 True ['factorial'] A clever observation!

Yes, you're absolutely right. The expression `3 * 2 * 1` can also be written as `3!`, and the `!` symbol is called the factorial symbol.

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. In other words:

`n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1`

For example:

* `3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6`
* `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`
* `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`

The factorial function is used in many areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics, algebra, and calculus. It's a fundamental concept in mathematics, and your observation is a great example of how mathematical notation can be concise and elegant!
254 False ['Ullman'] That would be Cate Blanchett!
255 True ['Niger'] The Songhai Empire was located in the region of West Africa that is now Mali, Niger, and Benin. Specifically, its capital was Gao, which is located in present-day Mali. The Songhai Empire was a powerful empire that existed from the 15th to the 16th century, and it was one of the largest and most influential empires in West African history.
256 True ['scallop'] A classic French dish! Coquilles St. Jacques is a popular French recipe that originated in the city of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie (now known as Saint-Jacques-de-la-Lande) in Brittany. The main ingredient in Coquilles St. Jacques is scallops, specifically scallop shells filled with a creamy mixture of scallops, butter, garlic, and white wine. The dish is often served as an appetizer or main course, and is typically garnished with parsley and breadcrumbs.
257 True ['mitochondria', 'mitochondrion'] The 1957 Scientific American article referred to the mitochondria as the "Powerhouse of the Cell".
258 True ['deadlocked'] The answer is "deadlocked".
259 True ['Quisling'] You're likely referring to Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian politician who collaborated with the Nazi occupation of Norway during World War II. Quisling was the leader of the Norwegian National Socialist Party (Nasjonal Samling) and served as the Minister-President of Norway from 1942 to 1945.

Quisling's name became synonymous with traitor due to his willingness to cooperate with the Nazi occupation and his attempts to eliminate the Norwegian resistance movement. He was arrested and executed by firing squad in 1945, shortly after the war ended.

The term "Quisling" has since been used to describe someone who betrays their country or people, often in a cowardly or treacherous manner.
260 False ['Harder to Breathe'] I think you're thinking of the wrong song! "Is There Anyone Out There?" is actually the title of a song by Pink Floyd, from their 1970 album "Atom Heart Mother".
261 True ['Orange'] The Ernest Oppenheimer Bridge spans the Orange River, which is a significant river in southern Africa.
262 True ['Charley Pride'] According to Jimmy Allen's song "Down Home", the trailblazing black country singer who died in 2020 is Charley Pride.
263 True ['Minoan'] The Phaistos Disc was found in 1908 during the excavation of the Palace of Phaistos, which was a Minoan palace located in the village of Phaistos, in the region of Messara, Crete, Greece. The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization that flourished on the island of Crete from around 2600 to 1100 BCE.
264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker you are referring to is Michel Foucault. His multi-volume work, "The History of Sexuality", explores the ways in which power dynamics in society have shaped our understanding and experience of sexuality. The book is a critical analysis of the ways in which sexuality has been constructed and regulated throughout history, and how this has been used to maintain social control and power imbalances.

The first volume, "The Will to Knowledge", was published in 1976 and is often considered the most influential. In it, Foucault argues that sexuality is not a natural or biological phenomenon, but rather a social construct that has been shaped by power dynamics and cultural norms. He contends that sexuality has been used as a means of social control, with those in power using it to regulate and discipline the bodies and desires of others.

Foucault's work has had a significant impact on the fields of sociology, philosophy, and cultural studies, and has influenced many subsequent thinkers and scholars. His ideas about the social construction of sexuality and the ways in which power operates through discourse and institutions continue to be widely debated and studied today.
265 True ['Walther'] A great piece of Bond trivia!

You're referring to the fact that Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, received a fan letter that referred to the Beretta as "A Lady's Gun". This led Fleming to switch Bond's gun to the Walther PPK (Polizei-Pistole Kriminalmodell), a German-made semi-automatic pistol.

In the early Bond novels, Bond was indeed armed with a Beretta, but after receiving this fan letter, Fleming decided to change Bond's gun to the Walther PPK, which became an iconic part of Bond's character.
266 True ['ooze'] Globigerina is a type of foraminifera, which are tiny, shelled organisms that are common in marine sediments. They are often found in large numbers on the ocean floor, and their shells can accumulate over time to form a type of sediment called "calcareous ooze".

Calcareous ooze is a type of marine sediment that is composed primarily of the shells and skeletons of tiny marine organisms, such as foraminifera, coccolithophores, and pteropods. These organisms are often small enough to be filtered from the water by marine organisms, such as zooplankton and fish, and their shells can accumulate on the ocean floor.

Globigerina is a specific type of foraminifera that is commonly found in calcareous ooze. Its shells are made of calcium carbonate and are often spherical in shape. Globigerina is an important component of the ocean's sedimentary record, as its shells can provide valuable information about the Earth's climate and ocean chemistry over millions of years.
267 True ['Brave New World'] The quote "What you need is a gramme of Soma. All the advantages of Christianity and Alcohol - none of their defects" is from the 1932 novel "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley.
268 True ['Murray'] The 1500 mile long Australian river that includes the Darling and the Murrumbidgee is the Murray River.
269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] Based on your question, it seems like you're referring to a knee surgery that involves repairing a ligament, and you're wondering about the recovery timeline.

The answer depends on the specific ligament that was repaired during the surgery. Here are some general guidelines:

* ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) repair: The recovery time for an ACL repair can take around 6-9 months, with full recovery taking up to a year.
* MCL (Medial Collateral Ligament) repair: The recovery time for an MCL repair is typically shorter, ranging from 3-6 months.
* PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament) repair: The recovery time for a PCL repair can take around 6-12 months.

Regarding the dissolving stitches, it's common for surgeons to use absorbable sutures for ligament repairs. These stitches are designed to dissolve over time, usually within 2-4 weeks. In your case, it's likely that the dissolving stitches will be gone within 3 weeks, as you mentioned.

Keep in mind that every individual's recovery process is unique, and the actual recovery time may vary depending on factors such as the severity of the injury, the individual's overall health, and the effectiveness of their rehabilitation program.

It's essential to follow your surgeon's specific instructions and guidelines for recovery, as well as attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. With proper care and rehabilitation, you can expect to make a full recovery and return to your normal activities.
270 True ['Morris'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have found the answer: William Morris (1834-1896), a British textile designer, artist, and writer, is the one you're looking for.

William Morris was a key figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, a design movement that emerged in the late 19th century. He was a co-founder of the Morris & Co. design firm, which produced a wide range of decorative arts, including wallpapers, fabrics, and furniture.

Morris designed many iconic wallpapers, including "Rose" and "Jasmine", which feature intricate floral patterns inspired by nature. His designs were characterized by their use of natural forms, bold colors, and intricate details.

Morris's wallpapers were highly influential and remain popular to this day. His designs have been reproduced and adapted by many manufacturers, and his legacy continues to inspire designers and artists.

So, there you have it! William Morris, the 19th-century designer with a name fit for a Hollywood agent, created the beautiful wallpapers, including "Rose" and "Jasmine", that you were thinking of.
271 True ['Addams Family Values'] A clever question!

In this 1993 movie, Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to summer camp, which is a central plot point in the film.

Am I correct?
272 False ['Done', 'Dun'] "Finished" and "Drab" are not homophones.

Homophones are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings and often different spellings. Examples of homophones include:

* to/too/two
* their/there/they're
* bare/bear
* fair/fare
* four/for

"Finished" and "Drab" are not pronounced the same, so they are not homophones. "Finished" is pronounced as /ˈfɪnɪʃt/ (FIN-ish-t), while "Drab" is pronounced as /dræb/ (DRAB).
273 True ['Zworykin'] The answer is Vladimir Zworykin, a Russian-born inventor and engineer. In 1923, Zworykin filed a patent for the Iconoscope, a type of television transmission tube that was the precursor to modern television cameras. Zworykin's invention used an iconoscope to capture live images and transmit them over the airwaves, marking a significant milestone in the development of television technology.
274 False ['Sharp Objects and Gone Girl', 'Sharp Objects Gone Girl'] I apologize, but I couldn't find any information on a book called "Sharp Girl" that contains two books by the same author. It's possible that you may have misspelled the title or that "Sharp Girl" is not a real book. Could you provide more context or clarify what you mean by "contained within"?
275 True ['Bayreuth'] The German music festival starting with 'B' that has been presenting the works of Wagner since 1876 is the Bayreuth Festival (Bayreuther Festspiel).
276 True ['Hoyle'] The answer is Edmond Hoyle. Edmond Hoyle was an 18th-century English writer and whist expert, and his name is often used as a reference to authority on card games, particularly whist.

279 True ['wasp'] That's a unique choice! The tarantula hawk (Pepsis sp.) is a type of wasp that preys on tarantulas. Specifically, it's a species of Pepsis wasp, which is a genus of large, hairy wasps that are known for their impressive size and powerful stingers. Tarantula hawks are known for their unique behavior of paralyzing tarantulas with their stings and then laying their eggs inside the tarantula's burrow, where the larvae can feed on the tarantula's body.
280 True ['Cronkite'] After Walter Cronkite, the legendary CBS news anchor, stepped down in 1981, Peter Mansbridge, the long-time anchor of CBC News, was often referred to as "the Walter Cronkite of Canada".
281 True ['Graham'] According to historical records, the male evangelist who drew more than 20,000 people to his revival meetings in a big tent in 1949 was Billy Graham.
282 True ['Odenkirk'] A great question!

The actor who returned to AMC in 'Lucky Hank' is Bob Odenkirk, who is best known for his role as Saul Goodman in the AMC series 'Better Call Saul' and 'Breaking Bad'. In 'Lucky Hank', Odenkirk plays the lead role of Hank Solovitch, a college professor who is struggling to find his place in the world. The show is a comedy-drama that premiered on AMC in 2023.
283 True ['lowkey'] I think I can help you with that!

The slang phrase you're referring to is likely "lowkey" or "lowkey goated" (meaning "lowkey greatest of all time"). "Lowkey" is a slang term that means "secretly" or "on the down-low," and it's often used to express a subtle or hidden feeling or opinion.

So, when someone says "lowkey goated," they're implying that something or someone is amazing, but in a subtle or understated way. It's like saying, "This is really great, but don't tell anyone, it's a secret!"

Does that sound about right?
284 True ['Cloisters'] What a fascinating question!

After some research, I think I have the answer: Jenna Bush recommends "The Cloisters" by Katy Simpson Smith, which is set at The Cloisters, a museum located in Upper Manhattan, New York City. The Cloisters is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) that is dedicated to the art and architecture of medieval Europe.

"The Cloisters" is a novel that explores themes of love, family, and faith in the 14th century, and it's indeed a Gothic tale with a strong sense of atmosphere and setting.
285 True ['Punchbowl'] The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific is located in Punchbowl Crater, which is a volcanic crater in Honolulu, Hawaii. The cemetery is situated on the slopes of the crater and honors the memory of over 38,000 American service members who died during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts.
286 False ['Healall'] Robert Frost's poem "Design" does not feature a specific flower known for its curative powers. The poem is actually about the speaker's observation of a spider's web and the way it seems to be "designed" to catch a moth, and the speaker's musings on the nature of fate and the universe.

The poem does mention a "moth" and a "web", but it does not specifically mention a flower. If you're thinking of a different poem by Robert Frost, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!
287 True ['Gastroenteritis'] The answer is GASTROENTERITIS.
288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] A classic!

The movie is: "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966)

And, of course, Marlon Brando's character, Colonel Walter Kurtz, is the one who gives the Yanks a bad name in "Apocalypse Now" (1979).
289 True ['Shinto'] The correct answer is Shintoism.

In Shintoism, Torii gates are typically seen at the entrance of shrines, but they can also be found marking the boundary between the secular world and the sacred. The Torii gate is a symbol of the separation between the profane and the sacred, and it serves as a threshold between the two realms. It is believed to purify and protect those who pass through it, and it is often decorated with Shinto symbols and offerings.
290 True ['Reposado'] A clever question!

The type of tequila you're referring to is called " Reposado", which is Spanish for "Rested". Reposado tequila is aged for a minimum of two months and a maximum of one year in oak barrels, which gives it a golden hue and a smoother flavor profile compared to other types of tequila.

During this resting period, the tequila absorbs the flavors and aromas of the oak barrels, which can include notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak. This aging process also helps to mellow out the harsher flavors and alcohols, resulting in a more refined and complex taste.

So, to answer your question, Reposado tequila takes a siesta in its barrel for several months, developing a golden hue and a rich, smooth flavor profile.
291 True ['Stockholm'] A dramatic question indeed!

August Strindberg, the Swedish playwright, novelist, and painter, died on May 14, 1912, in Stockholm, Sweden.
292 True ['Hagar'] According to the Bible, Sarah thought she was unable to give Abraham children, so she gave him her handmaid, Hagar, who bore Ishmael. This is recorded in Genesis 16:1-16.
293 True ['Gluon'] A clever question!

The answer is: Gluons!

Gluons are the particles that hold quarks together inside protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as hadrons. The name "gluon" comes from the word "glue", reflecting their role in binding quarks together.
294 False ['Tessera', 'Tessellation', 'tessellated'] I think I can help you with that!

The word you're looking for is "herringbone". A herringbone pattern is a distinctive flooring pattern that features small, rectangular tiles arranged in a zigzag or chevron design, typically made up of tiny squares or tiles.

295 True ['My So-Called Life', 'My So Called Life'] Claire Danes played the role of Angela Chase in the TV series "My So-Called Life" (1994-1995).

297 True ['Irene Cara'] I think there may be some confusion here!

The song "Flashdance... What a Feeling" was written by Keith Forsey and Irene Cara, and it was performed by Irene Cara for the 1983 film Flashdance. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1984.

Irene Cara is actually still alive, and she has continued to work as a singer and actress over the years. She has not passed away.

The National Recording Registry is a program of the Library of Congress that selects and preserves recordings that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". While "Flashdance... What a Feeling" is an iconic and influential song, it has not been selected for the National Recording Registry... yet!
298 False ['JuJu', 'joujou', 'gris'] You're referring to the mystical world of Voodoo!

In Voodoo shops, you can often find bags filled with a variety of ingredients, known as "mojo bags" or "conjure bags." These bags are designed to bring protection, good luck, and positive energy to the person carrying them. The ingredients used in these bags can vary depending on the shop and the intentions of the practitioner, but here are some common items you might find:

1. Herbs: Dried herbs like sage, sweetgrass, and chamomile are commonly used in mojo bags for their purifying and calming properties.
2. Spices: Spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg are believed to attract positive energy and ward off negative influences.
3. Charms: Small charms like coins, keys, or other trinkets are added to the bag to bring good fortune and prosperity.
4. Stones and crystals: Stones like black tourmaline, clear quartz, and citrine are believed to offer protection and amplify the bag's intentions.
5. Feathers: Feathers, especially those from birds like the owl or the raven, are thought to bring wisdom, intuition, and protection.
6. Essential oils: Essential oils like lavender, peppermint, and patchouli are added to the bag for their calming, uplifting, and purifying properties.
7. Resins: Resins like frankincense and myrrh are believed to purify and protect the wearer.
8. Curios: Small curios like shells, bones, or other natural objects are added to the bag to bring good luck and prosperity.

These bags are often sewn or tied shut and can be carried in a pocket, purse, or worn as a charm. The idea is that the ingredients in the bag will work together to attract positive energy and ward off negative influences, bringing good fortune and protection to the wearer.

Keep in mind that Voodoo is a complex and diverse spiritual tradition, and the ingredients and intentions used in mojo bags can vary greatly depending on the practitioner and their cultural background.
299 False ['Shelley'] I think I can help you identify the poet!

Based on your hints, I'm going to take a guess that the poet you're thinking of is Lord Byron. Specifically, I'm thinking of his poem "So, we'll go no more a roving" (also known as "So We'll Go No More a Roving"), which contains the lines:

"So, we'll go no more a roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright."

This poem is often interpreted as a lament for the passing of youth and the end of a romantic relationship. Byron was known for his passionate and romantic nature, and this poem is a classic example of his style.

Am I correct?
300 True ['Burundi'] The country you are referring to is Burundi.

302 False ['Leslie Groves'] The hard-driving US Army General you are referring to is Leslie R. Groves. He was the director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. Groves was a brigadier general in the US Army Corps of Engineers and was responsible for overseeing the project from its inception to the successful testing and eventual wartime use of the atomic bomb.

Groves was indeed known as the "Indispensable Man" of the Manhattan Project, and his leadership and management skills were instrumental in bringing the project to fruition. He was responsible for coordinating the efforts of thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians from various institutions and government agencies, and he played a key role in resolving the many technical and logistical challenges that arose during the project.

Groves was also known for his strong personality and his ability to get things done, which earned him the respect and admiration of many of the scientists and engineers who worked on the project. He was a demanding leader who expected a great deal from his team, but he was also fair and just, and he was willing to listen to and consider the opinions of others.

Overall, Leslie R. Groves was a highly effective and influential leader who played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb, and his legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by historians and scholars today.
303 True ['Chicago'] The riot you're referring to is the Haymarket affair, which occurred on May 4, 1886, in Haymarket Square, Chicago, Illinois. The riot was sparked by a labor protest and turned violent when a bomb was thrown into a group of police officers, killing several of them. The event led to the deaths of at least 7 people, including 4 police officers and 3 civilians, and injured many more. The Haymarket affair is considered a pivotal moment in the labor movement in the United States and is still commemorated today.
304 True ['Typee'] Herman Melville's first novel was "Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life", published in 1846.
305 True ['griot'] In the film "Night of the Kings" (La Nuit des Rois), the prisoner in Abidjan acts as a "Griot", which is a traditional West African storyteller. Griots are known for their ability to spin tales, sing songs, and recite poetry, often to entertain, educate, and preserve cultural heritage. In the film, the Griot's storytelling is a way for the prisoner to stay alive and connect with his fellow inmates.
306 True ['Eat, Pray, Love', 'Eat Pray Love'] The answer is "Eat, Pray, Love" by Elizabeth Gilbert.
307 False ['Marcel'] A clever play on words!

I think I have the answer: "Wave" goodbye to "Wavy" and "Wayne". Wayne is a boy's first name that was popular in the early 20th century, and "Wavy" is a hairstyling term that was popular during the same period. According to French naming trends, Wayne hasn't been a popular name in France since the 1920s. Am I correct?
308 True ['Livy'] The ancient scholar who wrote a 142-volume history of Rome that includes accounts of the battles against Hannibal is Livy (Titus Livius).

Livy was a Roman historian who lived from 59 BC to 17 AD. His most famous work is "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" (Books from the Founding of the City), a comprehensive history of Rome from its founding to the reign of Augustus Caesar. The work is divided into 142 books, although only 35 of them have survived to the present day.

Livy's history includes detailed accounts of the Second Punic War, including the battles against Hannibal, who was a Carthaginian general who invaded Italy in 218 BC. Livy's accounts of these battles are considered some of the most important sources of information about the war, and are still studied by historians today.

It's worth noting that while Livy's history is considered one of the most important sources of information about ancient Rome, it is not always considered to be entirely accurate or reliable. Many of the events described in the history are based on earlier sources that have not survived to the present day, and Livy's own biases and perspectives may have influenced his accounts. Nevertheless, Livy's history remains an important and influential work in the field of ancient Roman history.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] The answer is "Headed for the Open Sea" from the book "Two Years Before the Mast" by Richard Henry Dana Jr.
310 True ['Pangaea'] You're referring to the ancient supercontinent!

The supercontinent you're thinking of is called Pangaea, which is derived from the Greek words "pan" meaning "all" and "Gaia" meaning "Earth". Pangaea existed from about 300 to 200 million years ago during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. It was a single large landmass that gradually broke apart over millions of years, resulting in the seven continents we know today.

Pangaea was surrounded by a single global ocean, known as the Panthalassic Ocean, which covered most of the Earth's surface. The supercontinent was characterized by a single large landmass with several smaller continents and islands, including the modern-day continents of Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

The breakup of Pangaea is believed to have occurred due to plate tectonics, where the Earth's lithosphere (the outermost solid layer of the planet) is broken into large plates that move and interact with each other. This process led to the formation of new oceans, the creation of mountain ranges, and the shaping of the modern continents we see today.
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] The song "War Pigs" is by the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, not just any British heavy metal band. The song was released in 1970 on their second album, "Paranoid".

The lyrics of "War Pigs" are often interpreted as a critique of the Vietnam War and the military-industrial complex, with the "war pigs" referring to the politicians and military leaders who profit from war. The song's lyrics also contain references to the occult and Satanism, but in a metaphorical sense, rather than a literal one.

The song's writer, Ozzy Osbourne, has said that the song was meant to convey the idea that war is a form of Satanism, in the sense that it is a destructive and evil force that is driven by human greed and a desire for power. The song's lyrics also contain references to the idea that war is a form of mind control, with the "war pigs" using propaganda and manipulation to control people's minds and get them to fight in wars.

Overall, "War Pigs" is a powerful and thought-provoking song that has become one of Black Sabbath's most popular and enduring songs.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] I think I can help you with that!

If you'd like to provide more context or clarify the question, I'd be happy to try and help you out!
314 False ['Peccadillo'] A clever question!

The before-and-after phrase you're thinking of is likely "Freeze Frame"!

318 False ['The Way Way Back'] The 2013 film that refers to a place to sit in a station wagon (a 1970 Buick Estate) is "The Way, Way Back".
319 False ['fenugreek'] A clever question!

In Iran's national dish, Ghormeh Sabzi, the leaves with a European nationality in their name are Parsley (Persian: پودر) and Coriander (Persian: کرفس). Both of these herbs are commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine, including Iranian cooking.

Parsley, also known as "Persian parsley" or "European parsley" (Petroselinum crispum), is a popular herb in many European cuisines, including French, Italian, and Greek cooking.

Coriander, also known as "cilantro" or "Chinese parsley" (Coriandrum sativum), has a long history of use in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, including Iranian, Turkish, and Greek cooking.

So, to answer your question, the leaves with a European nationality in their name that are essential to Iran's national dish, Ghormeh Sabzi, are Parsley (Persian) and Coriander (Persian, but with European connections).
320 False ['Moldova'] You're referring to the dissolution of Yugoslavia!

In 1991, the Danube nation south of Ukraine, which is actually a region in Eastern Europe, not a nation, is the Republic of Bulgaria. However, Bulgaria was already an independent country since 1878 and was not part of Russia.

The correct answer is the Republic of Croatia, which declared its independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991. Croatia is a Danube River nation, and it is located south of Ukraine. After declaring independence, Croatia modified its name to the Republic of Croatia and joined the United Nations on May 22, 1992.

Yugoslavia was a country that existed from 1918 to 2003, comprising six republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. The country was formed after World War I and was a federal state with a strong central government. However, tensions between the different ethnic groups and republics led to a series of conflicts, including the Croatian War of Independence, the Bosnian War, and the Kosovo War, ultimately resulting in the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
321 True ['Byrd'] The American explorer who returned to Antarctica in the 1930s and had to be rescued in 1934, suffering from frostbite, was Richard E. Byrd.

Byrd led two expeditions to Antarctica, the first in 1928-1930 and the second in 1933-1935. During the second expedition, Byrd and his crew established a base camp at Little America, and Byrd flew over the Antarctic Plateau in a Fokker Trimotor aircraft. However, the expedition was plagued by bad weather, and Byrd's plane was forced to make an emergency landing in a snowstorm.

Byrd and his crew spent several days stranded in the snow, and Byrd suffered from severe frostbite on his feet and hands. They were eventually rescued by a relief expedition led by Byrd's friend and fellow explorer, Bernt Balchen.

Byrd's second expedition to Antarctica was marked by several notable achievements, including the first flight over the South Pole and the establishment of a new record for the highest altitude reached by an aircraft over Antarctica. However, the expedition was also marred by controversy and criticism, including allegations of poor planning and leadership. Despite these challenges, Byrd remained a celebrated figure in the world of exploration and continued to lead expeditions until his death in 1957.
322 True ['Broca'] The area of the left front part of the brain that contains neurons involved in speech function is named Broca's area, named after French neurologist Paul Broca.
323 False ['Kim Philby'] Harry Lime, the main character in Graham Greene's novel "The Third Man" and the 1949 film adaptation, is believed to have been inspired by Sidney Reilly, a Russian-born British spy and Soviet double agent.

Sidney Reilly, also known as the "Ace of Spies," was a real-life spy who worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and was involved in several high-profile espionage operations during World War I and the Russian Revolution. He was also suspected of being a double agent, working for the Soviet Union while pretending to be a loyal British agent.

Graham Greene was fascinated by Reilly's life and exploits, and many of the characteristics and events in "The Third Man" are thought to have been inspired by Reilly's story. Harry Lime, the charismatic and cunning protagonist of the novel and film, shares many similarities with Reilly, including his complex and troubled past, his involvement in espionage and counter-espionage, and his ability to manipulate those around him.

It's worth noting that Greene never explicitly confirmed the inspiration for Harry Lime, but many scholars and biographers have made the connection between Reilly and Lime based on the similarities between their lives and the themes and motifs in "The Third Man."
324 True ['greenback'] The Greenback Party was a political party in the United States that emerged in the 1870s and was primarily concerned with maintaining or increasing the circulation of paper money, specifically greenbacks, which were the paper currency issued by the U.S. government during the Civil War.

The party was formed in 1876 and was known for its advocacy of inflationary policies, including the expansion of the money supply and the reduction of interest rates. The party's platform called for the government to issue more paper money to stimulate economic growth and to reduce the national debt.

The party's name, "Greenback," referred to the green-colored paper currency that was issued by the government during the Civil War. The party's supporters believed that the circulation of more paper money would help to stimulate economic growth and to reduce poverty and unemployment.

The Greenback Party was a significant force in American politics during the late 19th century, and it played a key role in shaping the country's monetary policy. However, the party ultimately failed to achieve its goals and was eventually absorbed into other political parties.
325 False ['Nutmegger'] A clever question!

I think I have the answer: "Maine-iacs"! As in, some New Englanders aren't from Connecticut, but are from Maine, and the term "Mainiac" is often used to refer to someone from Maine. And, of course, Maine is famous for its use of cinnamon in its baked goods, like apple cinnamon donuts and cinnamon rolls.
326 False ['phlox'] What a lovely gesture!

I think I can help you identify the pink-colored flowers ending in 'x'. Based on my knowledge, I'm going to take a guess that the flowers you picked might be:

1. Petunax - Petunax is a type of petunia, a popular annual flower that comes in a variety of colors, including pink. The name "petunax" is not a common botanical name, but it's possible that you might have seen it used as a nickname or a colloquialism.
2. Scaevax - Scaevax is a type of saxifrage, a genus of flowering plants that includes about 400 species. Some species of saxifrage have pink flowers, and the name "scaevax" might be a variation of the scientific name Saxifraga.
3. Pox - Pox is a type of flower that belongs to the genus Poxia, which is part of the family Asteraceae (daisy family). Pox flowers are known for their pink or white petals and are often used in floral arrangements.

If none of these options match the flowers you picked, please provide more information or details about the flowers, such as their shape, size, and any distinctive features. I'll do my best to help you identify them!
327 True ['Pictures at an Exhibition'] The answer is: Pictures at an Exhibition!

Each of the 10 movements of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" represents a piece of art on display at an exhibition of the works of his late friend, Viktor Hartmann, a Russian artist and architect. The movements are inspired by the titles and descriptions of the artworks on display, and are meant to evoke the atmosphere and emotions evoked by the exhibition.
328 False ['Dewey'] Earl Warren was never a Vice President of the United States. He was the 30th Governor of California from 1943 to 1953 and later became the 14th Chief Justice of the United States, serving from 1953 to 1969.
329 True ['phrenology'] Franz Joseph Gall developed the pseudoscience known as phrenology, which attempted to discern personality, intelligence, and character traits by examining the shape and size of the skull.

The Czech authorities considered the novel to be too critical of the communist regime and refused to grant it permission to be published.

Wisconsin's largest island is actually Madeline Island, which is located in Lake Superior. However, if you're looking to catch northern pike and largemouth bass, I'd recommend heading to Lake Chippewa instead.

Lake Chippewa is a popular destination for fishing, and it's known for its abundant population of northern pike and largemouth bass. The lake is located in the northwestern part of Wisconsin, near the town of Chippewa Falls.

To get to Lake Chippewa, you can take US-53 north from Eau Claire, then turn west onto WI-29. Continue on WI-29 for about 20 miles, then turn north onto County Road K. Follow County Road K for about 10 miles, and you'll arrive at the lake.

Make sure to check the local fishing regulations and obtain any necessary permits before you head out. And don't forget to pack your gear, including your RV, fishing rods, and tackle box!

Have a great time on the lake, and good luck with your fishing adventure!
336 False ['Brancusi'] You're referring to the famous Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși!

Constantin Brâncuși (1876-1957) was a Romanian sculptor who is known for his minimalist and abstract works. Around 1908, he began carving several versions of "The Kiss" from blocks of stone, which became one of his most iconic and enduring works.

Brâncuși's "The Kiss" is a series of sculptures that depict two figures embracing, with their faces pressed together and their bodies entwined. The work is characterized by its simplicity, elegance, and emotional intensity. The sculptures are often rendered in a range of materials, including marble, limestone, and bronze.

Brâncuși's "The Kiss" is considered a masterpiece of modernist sculpture and has been widely exhibited and admired around the world. It's a testament to the artist's innovative style and his ability to capture the essence of human emotion through his work.
337 True ['Boyhood'] The answer is "Boyhood".

340 True ['Frankfurter'] The Vienna-born man who was the third Supreme Court Justice was Felix Frankfurter. The dual biography you're referring to is likely "Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter: Their Friendship and the Court" by Melvin I. Urofsky.
341 True ['atom'] The "Plum Pudding" model for the internal structure of the atom was replaced by the planetary model.

The Plum Pudding model, also known as the "Saturnian" model, was proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1904. According to this model, the atom was thought to be a sphere of positively charged matter, with negatively charged electrons embedded throughout the sphere like plums in a pudding.

However, this model had some limitations, such as not being able to explain the stability of the atom and the discrete energy levels of electrons.

The planetary model, also known as the "Rutherford model", was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. According to this model, the atom was thought to be a small, dense nucleus at the center, surrounded by electrons orbiting around it like planets around the sun. This model was able to explain the stability of the atom and the discrete energy levels of electrons, and it was a major breakthrough in the understanding of atomic structure.

So, to summarize, the Plum Pudding model was replaced by the planetary model in the early 1900's.
342 True ['Nikkei'] That's correct! Japan's equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is called the Nikkei 225.

347 False ['Histrionic'] I think I can help you with that!

The article you're referring to is likely from the New York Times, and it's dated April 1932. The article is titled "F.D.R.'s Unexpected Gift: The Dramatic is Not Without Value in Politics" and it discusses Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) ability to connect with people through his charisma and storytelling skills.

The article highlights FDR's "unexpected" ability to use his dramatic flair to win over audiences and build a connection with the American people. The author notes that FDR's use of storytelling and emotional appeals was a departure from the traditional, dry, and formal approach to politics, and that it was a key factor in his success as a politician.

The article quotes FDR himself, who said, "I have always believed that the dramatic is not without value in politics. It is a way of getting people to think about things they might not think about otherwise."

The article goes on to discuss how FDR's use of drama and storytelling helped him to connect with people on a deeper level, and how it allowed him to build a sense of trust and rapport with his audience. The author concludes that FDR's ability to use drama and storytelling was a key factor in his success as a politician, and that it was a valuable asset in his campaign for the presidency.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
348 True ['Kafka'] A fascinating question!

The answer is Franz Kafka, a renowned Czech writer known for his dark, psychological, and often unsettling short stories and novels. Kafka was indeed born a Jew and became a Bar Mitzvah on June 13th, 1896, in Prague, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Kafka's writing often explored themes of alienation, anxiety, and the absurd, which have become hallmarks of his unique literary style. His works, such as "The Metamorphosis," "The Trial," and "The Castle," have had a profound influence on modern literature and continue to be widely read and studied today.

So, there you have it!

In the song, Ringo Starr sings about using his "Silver Hammer" to take out various people, including Joan, a school teacher, and even the judge at his trial. The song is known for its surreal and nonsensical lyrics, and this verse is a great example of that!
350 False ['Morgan'] What a fascinating character! I believe you're referring to Sir Thomas Modyford, a Welsh buccaneer who indeed rose to become the Deputy Governor of Jamaica in 1674.

Modyford was born in 1620 in Wales and began his career as a privateer, plundering Spanish ships and colonies in the Caribbean. He eventually settled in Jamaica, where he became a prominent figure in the island's early history.

In 1674, Modyford was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica by King Charles II, and he served in that role until 1678. During his tenure, he worked to establish a more formal government in Jamaica, and he also played a key role in the development of the island's sugar industry.

Modyford's life is a testament to the complex and often tumultuous history of the Caribbean during the 17th century. He was a true buccaneer, with a reputation for bravery and cunning, but he also demonstrated a capacity for leadership and diplomacy.

So here's to Sir Thomas Modyford, a true Welsh buccaneer who left his mark on the history of Jamaica! May his legacy be remembered with a glass of fine rum.

354 False ['Endorphins'] What a lovely question!

When someone gives or receives a hug, it releases oxytocin, often referred to as the "cuddle hormone." Oxytocin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in social bonding, trust, and relaxation. It's often released during physical touch, such as hugging, kissing, or sex.

Oxytocin is named in part for the Greek word "otokos," meaning "birth," because it was first discovered in the 1920s during childbirth. It was later found to be released during other social bonding activities, like hugging and kissing.

Oxytocin is often referred to as a "natural painkiller" because it can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It's also been linked to improved mood, reduced blood pressure, and even increased feelings of trust and empathy.

So, go ahead and give someone a hug – it's a great way to release those feel-good hormones and strengthen your bond with others!
