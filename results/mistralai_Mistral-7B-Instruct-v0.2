0 False ['Bogart'] The last name you're looking for is "Ball." Although it's associated with the iconic Hollywood figure, O.J. Simpson, the verb form "ball" means to monopolize or hog something, which is not cool. However, it's essential to note that O.J. Simpson's last name does not have any connection to the verb "ball."
1 True ['Fiji'] The country you're referring to is Fiji. Approximately 70% of Fiji's population lives on Viti Levu, its largest island. This is due to the island's greater resources and opportunities for employment compared to the smaller islands.
2 False ['Calder'] Artist: Why must art be static? Why can't it move and evolve with its environment and viewers? The next step in sculpture is motion.

This quote challenges the traditional definition of art as a static object and suggests that incorporating motion can add new dimensions to the artistic experience. It reflects the evolving nature of art and the artist's desire to push boundaries and explore new possibilities.
3 False ['The Philosophers Stone'] In J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, Harry uses a substance called "Gobbet's Gold Transfiguration Paste" to turn a snail into a gold coin. This is a fictional transfiguration tool from the Harry Potter universe and not related to medieval alchemy or its tinctures.

In medieval alchemy, the substance often associated with the transmutation of metals into gold is called the "Philosopher's Stone" or "Elixir of Life." However, it's important to note that there's no concrete evidence that alchemists ever succeeded in creating such a substance. It's more of a myth and a symbol of the alchemical quest for spiritual enlightenment and the pursuit of eternal life.

There are several substances that alchemists believed could help in the process of transmutation, such as mercury and sulfur, but none of them could turn base metals into gold in reality.
4 False ['Leontyne Price'] I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The American singer known as "LP" (Laura Nyro) did not release an opera album titled "The Blue Album" in 1961. There seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the term "Blue Album" in this context. In the world of opera, there isn't a widely recognized "Blue Album" associated with an American woman singer named LP.
5 True ['Space Station'] Commander John Sheridan and the crew of the spaceship "Babylon 5" did not live in a traditional TV place or setting. Instead, they inhabited a massive, rotating, self-contained orbital habitat and space station in space. This station, also called Babylon 5, served as a diplomatic and cultural center for various alien races and humans in the late 23rd century. It was designed to promote peace among the different species and provide a neutral ground for resolving conflicts.
6 True ['Tyler'] The correct answer is William Henry Harrison and John Tyler. However, it's essential to note that Tyler did not serve as Harrison's running mate during the War of 1812. Instead, they served together in the military during the war, but Harrison was the commander-in-chief, and Tyler was a soldier under his command. They were not running mates until the presidential election of 1840, when Tyler was elected as Harrison's successor after Harrison's death just a month into his presidency.
7 False ['Elvis Costello'] The British musician inspired by Burt Bacharach and who collaborated with him on the album "Painted from Memory" is Elaine Paige. Elaine Paige is a renowned English singer and actress, known for her work in musical theatre and her collaborations with various artists. The album "Painted from Memory," released in 1997, marked Bacharach's return to recording after a long hiatus and featured Elaine Paige as his duet partner. The collaboration resulted in a critically acclaimed album that showcased Bacharach's signature style while incorporating contemporary influences.
8 True ['Corinth'] The correct answer is the Isthmus of Corinth. This geographical feature in Greece has historical significance as it was the site of an ancient city called Corinth, which was renowned for its wealth and prosperity. The modern city of Corinth is also located nearby. The isthmus was the location of the famous ancient Greek canal, the Diolkos, which facilitated the transportation of ships between the Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea, reducing the need for a lengthy navigational journey around the Peloponnese.
9 True ['The Woman in White'] The novel you're referring to is "The Woman in White" by Wilkie Collins. In this classic English mystery novel, Anne Catherick is a central character who is often described as wearing a particular dress of a specific color. However, to add an element of mystery, I won't reveal the color here. If you're interested in finding out, I would recommend reading the novel to uncover this detail and many others.
10 True ['Eucalyptus'] Eucalyptus Oil: Eucalyptus oil is a common ingredient in Vicks VapoRub, known for its strong, medicinal aroma. Along with menthol and camphor, it contributes to the product's effectiveness in providing relief from symptoms of the common cold, such as congestion and muscle pain.
11 True ['Run Interference'] The idiom you're looking for is "run interference for someone."

However, this idiom is not limited to football and can be used in various other contexts as well.
12 True ['Virginia Woolf'] The woman's story that is illustrated by her sister Vanessa Bell, also a member of the Bloomsbury Group, is that of Virginia Woolf. Vanessa Bell created several portraits of her sister, including a famous one painted in 1912, which is now held at the Tate Modern in London. Virginia Woolf was a renowned modernist writer, and her works, such as "Mrs. Dalloway" and "To the Lighthouse," are considered classics of modern literature. The Bloomsbury Group was a collective of intellectuals, writers, and artists who lived and worked in the Bloomsbury area of London in the early 20th century. They were known for their progressive ideas and their influence on modern art, literature, and culture.
13 True ['Fait Accompli'] The situation you're describing is called a "fait accompli" in French. This term translates to "accomplished fact" in English and refers to an action that has already been completed before those affected by it are informed or have the opportunity to prevent it. Once the fact is accomplished, it becomes a concluded fact that cannot be changed.
14 True ['Arsenic'] Arsenic is the poisonous element from which Salvarsan, the first effective treatment for syphilis, was derived. Salvarsan is an arsenical compound, specifically named 606 from its development number in the German chemical company Hoechst's research lab. It was discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1910 and was a significant breakthrough in the treatment of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease that was previously considered incurable.
15 True ['Jon Batiste'] Jon Batiste, a New Orleans-born pianist and musician, achieved a remarkable feat in 2021. He won an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 94th Academy Awards for his work on the film "Soul." Simultaneously, he released a new album titled "We Are." Batiste has been the bandleader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert since 2015, and he continued to maintain this role while pursuing his musical career and film projects.
16 True ['Customs'] Upon returning to Earth, the Apollo 11 astronauts had to declare the Moon rocks they had collected to the United States Customs Service. This was to ensure the legal entry of the extraterrestrial material into the country.
17 True ['O. Henry'] I regret to inform you that there seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. The author of "The Gift of the Magi," a short story about self-sacrificing love, is O. Henry (William Sydney Porter). However, he wrote this story in 1905, not in 1898. Furthermore, there is no evidence that O. Henry spent time in jail for embezzlement in 1898. He was actually pardoned and released from prison in 1902, after serving a three-year sentence for embezzlement.
18 True ['Byzantine'] The Byzantine Era

Byzantine art, which emerged from the Eastern Roman Empire (330-1453 A.D.), is renowned for its intricate mosaics. These works of art often featured detailed depictions of religious scenes, mythological figures, and geometric patterns. The cornucopia, a symbol of abundance and prosperity, is a common motif in Byzantine mosaics, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of this era.
19 True ['Ethiopia'] The correct answer is Ethiopia. Hubert Julian was an American aviator and musician who gained fame for skydiving while playing the saxophone. He volunteered to fight for Ethiopia during the Italian invasion in the 1930s. Ethiopia was the last African empire to resist European colonization, and the Italian invasion, also known as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, took place from 1935 to 1936.

In "Moll Flanders," a novel published in 1722, the protagonist, Moll, recounts her life story, which includes a series of criminal activities and various professions as she ascends the social ladder. Daniel Defoe, an English writer, is the author of this work.
25 False ['Extant'] There are several things that may still exist with the prefix "Ex" that refer to something that was once a part of a larger context but now exists independently. Here are a few examples:

1. Ex-libris: An ex-libris is a bookplate or label indicating ownership of a book. These were often created as works of art and can still be found in libraries and private collections.

26 True ['Desperado'] The middle film in Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi trilogy, which is also the title of an Eagles hit song, is "Desperado." Released in 1995, this film is a sequel to Rodriguez's 1992 low-budget independent film "El Mariachi." The Eagles' song "Desperado" was first recorded in 1973 and appeared on their album of the same name. The title of the film was inspired by this iconic song.
27 False ['Siamang'] The answer to this riddle is "Orang-utan." Orangutans are endangered great apes native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra in Malaysia and Indonesia. Their name means "man of the forest" in Malay. Despite their popularity in zoos and documentaries, many people may not be familiar with the specific name of this remarkable primate.
28 False ['Abide With Me'] The phrases "fast falls the eventide" and "in life, in death, O Lord, do what thou wilt" come from different hymns or spirituals.

The first phrase, "fast falls the eventide," is from the hymn "Erectus Was a Tower," which was written by John Greenleaf Whittier in 1868. The full line is "Ere the sun expire, and twilight fail, / Fast falls the eventide." This line is often used to express the fleeting nature of time and the urgency to make the most of each moment.

The second phrase, "in life, in death, O Lord, do what thou wilt," is from the spiritual "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." The full line is "Swing low, sweet chariot / Coming for to carry me home / Swing low, sweet chariot / I look over Jordan and what do I see / Stretching for miles, and reaching for the sky / Zion, that beautiful city / Swing low, sweet chariot / In life, in death, O Lord, do what thou wilt." This line is a plea for God's will to be done in all aspects of life, including in the moment of death.
29 True ['Tito'] The 20th century leader who went by one name and didn't live to see the collapse of Yugoslavia was Josip Broz Tito. He was the president of Yugoslavia from 1953 until his death in 1980. Tito was a key figure in European politics after World War II and played a significant role in the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement. However, the tensions and conflicts that eventually led to the collapse of Yugoslavia began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s, several years after Tito's death.
30 True ['Don Carlos', 'Don Carlo'] The title character in a Verdi opera who is the son of the King of Spain is Don Carlos. The opera "Don Carlos" (originally titled "Don Carlo") was premiered in 1867 and is based on the play "El Inesperado" by Friedrich Schiller. The plot revolves around Don Carlos, the infante of Spain, who falls in love with his stepmother, Elisabetta de Valois, and the ensuing conflict with his father, King Philip II of Spain.
31 True ['Humboldt'] The cold current you are referring to is called the "Garua Current." However, it is important to note that the name "Garua" actually refers to the persistent mist or low-lying clouds that form over the Galapagos Islands due to the interaction between this cold current and the islands' topography. The current itself is commonly known as the "Humboldt Current" or "Peru Current," named after the German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, who first documented its existence in the late 18th century.
32 False ['Alphabet City'] The East Village neighborhood in Manhattan, which runs through Avenues A, B, C, and D, has long been known as a hub for artists due to its affordable living spaces and vibrant cultural scene. This area has been a mecca for artists since the 1960s and 1970s, with many famous artists, musicians, and writers having lived and worked there. Some notable residents include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, and Patti Smith. The East Village's rich artistic history is reflected in its many galleries, studios, and cultural institutions, making it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in the arts.
33 False ['The Special Branch'] Sydney Reilly was a British intelligence officer and businessman, best known for his exploits as an agent during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is often referred to as an "ace of spies." Reilly worked primarily for the Secret Service Bureau, which was the forerunner of the Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). The term "Special" was not part of the name of the department with which Reilly was associated during his career.
34 True ['Nader'] I apologize for the error in my previous response. The correct answer for the third-party candidate in Florida during the 2000 presidential election is Ralph Nader, who received 97,488 votes.
35 True ['Jill Scott'] The "The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency" series of books, authored by Alexander McCall Smith, has been adapted into a television series. The lead role of Precious Ramotswe, the Botswana-based detective, is portrayed by actress Jill Scott. There is no mention of a "Golden Singer" involved in the series.
36 True ['Constantine'] The event you're referring to is the supposed vision of the Emperor Constantine I, not in 312 A.D., but in 312 or 313 A.D. During the Battle of Milvian Bridge, Constantine is said to have seen a cross in the sky with the words "In Hoc Signo Vinces" (In this sign, you will conquer). This vision is believed to have influenced Constantine's decision to adopt Christianity as the dominant religion of the Roman Empire.
37 True ['Ardern'] I apologize for the confusion, but there has been no 42-year-old prime minister of New Zealand in 2023. The current prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was born in 1980, making her 42 years old in 2022. However, she announced her intention to step down as prime minister in early 2023, but she has not yet left the job as of now. Therefore, I cannot provide an exact answer to this question based on the given information.
38 False ['Fossa'] In the animated film "Madagascar," a carnivore with retractable claws named "Mason and Phil" (also known as the "Circus Tigers") are portrayed as non-threatening to lemurs and other animals. These tigers have been trained by humans to perform in a circus, and they have a more comical and friendly demeanor compared to their ferocious and terrifying counterparts in real life.
39 False ['Ensconced'] The answer to your riddle is "fixed." A light fixture that is "fixed" is permanently installed and not going anywhere.
40 False ['The Power of the Dog'] I apologize for any confusion, but there is no 2021 Western film in which Benedict Cumberbatch is afflicted by weaponized anthrax that was originally a cattle disease. Anthrax is a real bacterial disease that can affect various animals, including cattle, but there is no known instance of it being weaponized in this manner in reality or in fiction, let alone in a Western film featuring Benedict Cumberbatch.
41 True ['The Turn of the Screw'] The opera "The Turn of the Screw" by Benjamin Britten is based on Henry James' novella of the same name. In the story, a governess becomes convinced that the two children in her care are being influenced by the malevolent spirits of former employees, Peter Quint and Miss Jessel.
42 False ['Night Vale'] I apologize for any confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. Wil Wheaton is an actor known for his roles in various films and television shows, including "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "The Big Bang Theory." He has also been involved in podcasting, hosting the Tabletop gaming podcast.

However, there is no podcast called "Welcome to What Strange Town Where Stranger Things Happen" that I'm aware of, and Wil Wheaton has not played a chef named Tourniquet in that show or any other podcast that I can find. If you have more information or if there's a specific episode or source you're referring to, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you out.
43 True ['Chisholm'] The woman who won 152 delegates in the Democratic primaries during the 1972 presidential election before withdrawing from the race was Shirley Chisholm. She was the first Black woman to run for the presidency in a major party in the United States. Chisholm ran a strong campaign, winning primaries in New Jersey, Florida, and Massachusetts, and finishing second in several others. However, she was unable to secure enough delegates to win the nomination, and ultimately withdrew from the race before the Democratic National Convention.
44 False ['Jacobs Ladder'] The term you're looking for is not directly related to the Bible, but rather to the electrical phenomenon itself. Ionized air that maintains the moving spark in a high-voltage traveling arc is commonly referred to as a "corona discharge." This term is not derived from any biblical name. Corona discharges occur when a high voltage is applied to a sharp point or edge, causing the air around it to ionize and form a luminous discharge.
45 True ['The Metro'] The line you have provided is actually the second line of Ezra Pound's poem titled "In a Station of the Metro." The first line of the poem is "The apparition of these faces in the crowd." Therefore, there is no letter "M" in the title of this poem.
46 True ["Harry's House"] The third solo pop music album by Mr. Styles is titled "Harry's House." The possessive title indicates that the album belongs to Harry Styles.
47 False ['Eroica'] The name for the Beethoven symphony you're looking for is "Sexy" with one letter removed, which is "Sensuous," but there isn't a Beethoven symphony with that name. Beethoven's symphonies are numbered, and the seventh symphony is often referred to as the "Pastoral Symphony." If you meant to ask about a book title, please provide more context.
48 True ['Yemen'] The blank in the title of the international movie "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen" should be filled with the word "Yemen". So the complete title is "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen".
49 True ['Pillars of Hercules', 'Hercules'] The correct answer is the Pillars of Hercules. The Pillars of Hercules are a pair of mythological columns that mark the ancient westernmost limits of the classical world and the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. They are located at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar, which separates Europe from Africa. Spain's flag indeed features the emblems of its historic kingdoms, but the Pillars of Hercules are not part of those emblems. They are represented separately on the flag as two towers on either side of the shield.
50 True ['Crohn'] The name of the foundation you are referring to is the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation. The dance in 1967 featuring Ella Fitzgerald was held to honor Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, who, along with Drs. Leon G. Lebovitz and Gordon D. Oppenheimer, described Crohn's disease in 1932.
51 False ['Upcycle', 'Upcycling'] The term you're looking for is "upswing." An economic upswing refers to a period of economic growth and expansion, where business activity is increasing. The term "green" in this context doesn't have a specific meaning related to economics. However, in a broader sense, "green economy" refers to an economy that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. So, a green upswing could be interpreted as an economic expansion that is sustainable and environmentally friendly.
52 True ['Lisbon'] King Carlos I of Portugal and his eldest son, Prince Luis Filipe, were assassinated in Lisbon on February 1, 1908. The assassination took place in the Praça do Comércio, a large square overlooking the Tagus River in Lisbon. The king and prince were attending a military parade when they were attacked by members of the Republican Party, who opposed the monarchy and sought to establish a republic in Portugal. The assassins, Fernandes Costa and Albino da Silva, fired several shots at the royal procession, killing both Carlos I and Luis Filipe, as well as several bystanders. The assassination marked the end of the Portuguese monarchy and the beginning of the First Portuguese Republic.
53 False ['Jubjub'] "Beware the Jabberwock, my son," is a line from Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky," which was first published in 1871 as part of his novel "Through the Looking-Glass." The Jabberwock is a mythical creature from the poem, described as having "jaws that bite, claws that catch," and a tongue that "sings and speaks and hisses all at once."

As for the bird that repeats itself and is not found in any ornithological books, you may be thinking of the "frabjous" bird mentioned in Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky." The line "Beware the frabjous day!" is spoken by the Jabberwocky itself, and the bird is described as having "tangerine-tree" and "mimsy" feathers. Carroll created these words and the concept of the frabjous bird as part of his whimsical and nonsensical poetry.
54 True ['Inigo Jones'] The person you're referring to is most likely Inigo Jones. He is indeed considered England's first great architect, and he began working on the Queen's House in Greenwich, London, in 1616. This building is considered England's first classical building, as Jones introduced the classical architectural style to England.
55 True ['Revolutionary Road'] The novel you are referring to is likely "Revolutionary Road" by Richard Yates. The title does not directly mean that the "what of 1776 hit a dead end in the 1950's." However, the title does reflect the theme of the novel, which is about the disillusionment and frustration of two married couples, Frank and April Wheeler, as they struggle to find meaning and happiness in their suburban lives in the 1950's. The title suggests a sense of revolution and rebellion against the conventional life they have settled for, which is a nod to the revolutionary spirit of the American Revolution. The "dead end" aspect of the title may refer to the feeling of being trapped and unable to escape the monotony and dissatisfaction of their lives.
56 True ['medulla oblongata'] The lowest part of the brain stem is called the "medulla oblongata." The medulla is responsible for several essential functions, including controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. It also plays a role in the regulation of consciousness and the transmission of sensory information to the higher brain centers.
57 False ['Kool Herc'] The name that DJ Clive Campbell used at the August 11, 1973 party, which is considered the birthplace of hip-hop music, was "Grandmaster Flash." The name was inspired by the mythical strongman character, "Flash Gordon." This moniker reflected his skill in quickly manipulating records on the turntables, a key aspect of early hip-hop DJing.
58 False ['Cuspidor'] The anagram for "Crisp Duo" that could mean "perfect receptacle" is "Precious Cup." While "Crisp" suggests something cool and refreshing, "Precious" signifies something valuable and "Cup" is a receptacle used for holding liquids.
59 False ['Giraffe'] The term "amble" refers to a particular way of walking, typically described as a steady, rhythmic gait with each foot touching the ground in turn. This type of gait is commonly observed in horses and some other large animals.

Regarding your second question, the animal you're describing is a "kangaroo." Kangaroos are marsupials native to Australia, and they have a unique locomotion method where both hind limbs move together in a hopping motion, while their tail acts as a balance and propulsion aid. This is different from the way most other animals, including humans and okapis, move.
60 True ['Wesley'] There is no John founding Methodism with an American university named after him. John Wesley, an English clergyman, is the founder of the Methodist denomination. However, there are several universities in the United States with Methodist affiliations, such as Wesleyan University in Connecticut and Southern Methodist University in Texas, but they are not named after specific Johns from the Methodist tradition.
61 True ['Perdition'] Tom Hanks' most famous role related to a "Road" leading to spiritual loss or ruin is from the film "Road to Perdition" (2002). In this movie, Hanks portrays Michael Sullivan, a father who is forced to go on the run with his son after they both become targets for assassination. The title "Road to Perdition" refers to their journey towards destruction and ultimately, spiritual ruin.
62 True ['Muir'] The national monument in Marin County, California, famous for its old growth redwoods, is named after John Muir. However, Muir's Redwood Park in Marin County was merged into Muir Woods National Monument and Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1908, and Muir himself did not officially name it. The area was later designated as a national monument in 1908, a year after Muir's death, in recognition of his conservation efforts.
63 True ['Jack Aubrey'] The hero of Patric O'Brian's books that came to cinemas with Russell Crowe is Jack Aubrey. The films are called the "Aubrey-Maturin" series, and they are based on O'Brian's novels about the friendship between Jack Aubrey, a captain in the Royal Navy, and Stephen Maturin, a doctor and spy. The first film in the series is called "Master and Commander" and was released in 2003.
64 True ['bluebonnet'] The Texas trail you are referring to is likely the "Bluebonnet Trail." Bluebonnets are the state flower of Texas. During the spring season, this trail is famous for its beautiful displays of bluebonnet flowers, which bloom along the roadsides and in fields across the state. The Bluebonnet Trail is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, who come to enjoy the scenic beauty of the wildflowers.
65 True ['Norway'] Jens Stoltenberg is the Prime Minister of Norway. In 2008, he placed rice seeds as the inaugural deposit in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault located in the archipelago of Svalbard, Norway. This seed vault is a backup facility for seeds from various seed banks around the world to ensure the preservation of global plant biodiversity.
66 True ['Pacific'] The May 18, 1942, issue of Time Magazine featured a cover story about Chester W. Nimitz, who was in command of the U.S. Pacific Fleet during World War II. At that time, the Pacific Fleet was based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which was a significant location due to its strategic importance in the Pacific Theater of the war. The fleet was responsible for defending U.S. interests in the Pacific Ocean and projecting American military power in the region. Nimitz played a crucial role in leading the U.S. Pacific Fleet during the war, including the naval battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, which helped turn the tide of the war in the Pacific in favor of the Allies.
67 False ['Third Rock from the Sun'] The TV sitcom you're referring to is "Major League," but you might have mistakenly thought of "The Adventures of Pete & Repeat" or "Welcome Back, Kotter" instead, as both of those shows featured a character named Arnold Horshack who made a famous line about the "Solomon Sisters being out of this world." However, there isn't a sitcom called "The Solomons" or any other show with that name that features an out-of-this-world family.

"Major League," on the other hand, is a sports comedy film series, not a sitcom. There isn't a sitcom with the Solomon family from "Major League."

If you meant a different sitcom with an out-of-this-world Solomon family, please provide more details.
68 True ['Tuvalu'] The former Ellice Islands are now known as Tuvalu, a small island nation located in the Pacific Ocean. Tuvalu derives a significant portion of its revenue from leasing the .tv top-level domain name. The ".tv" domain is popularly used for websites related to television and video content.
69 True ['Trepanning', 'trepanation', 'trephination', 'trephining'] The medical procedure you are referring to is called trepanation. Trepanation is an ancient surgical practice in which a hole is drilled into the skull to relieve pressure on the brain, treat infections, or for various other reasons, including religious or ritualistic beliefs. The belief that trepanation was used to release evil spirits is a common misconception. In fact, there is no scientific evidence to support this idea. The practice of trepanation dates back to at least 6,000 years ago, and it has been found in various cultures around the world.
70 True ['Templar'] The most famous case of mass trials and executions for heresy in Paris during the year 1310 was not actually in that year but rather in 1307 and 1314. The heresy in question was not related to the Knights Templar, as is commonly believed, but rather to the Knights Hospitaller and the Beguines and Beghards, who were not knights but rather religious laypeople.

The trials and executions were carried out under the orders of King Philip IV of France, who was suspicious of the wealth and power of these religious orders and believed that they were hiding secret heretical beliefs. The most famous figure associated with these trials was Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, who was arrested in October 1307 and later confessed to various heretical practices under torture. He was burned at the stake along with other high-ranking Templars in March 1314.

The trials and executions of the Knights Hospitaller and the Beguines and Beghards took place over a longer period of time, with the arrests beginning in 1307 and continuing into the 1320s. The exact number of people who were tried and executed is not known, but it is estimated that several thousand were involved.

It is important to note that the trials and executions were not carried out by the Inquisition, which did not exist in France at that time. Instead, they were carried out by the secular authorities under the direction of King Philip IV. The heresy charges were based on false testimonies and confessions obtained through torture, and the trials were deeply controversial at the time and have been the subject of much debate and criticism ever since.
71 True ['Coulis'] The answer to your riddle is "Raspberry Coulis." Although the term "compote" refers to cooked fruit in syrup, the sauce you're describing is actually a "coulis," which is a thick, smooth puree that is often strained to remove seeds or pulp. The silent consonant at the end of the word is "s," but it's not pronounced because the "ou" combination in "coulis" acts as a single syllable.
72 False ['William Faulkner'] The Compson brothers Benjy, Quentin, and Jason are characters in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel "The Sound and the Fury." Benjy, the retarded brother, narrates the first section of the novel. Quentin, the intellectual and troubled eldest brother, is the focus of the second section, and Jason, the pragmatic and cynical youngest brother, is the narrator of the final section.
73 True ['Pinniped'] The correct answer is "Pinnipeds." Although it may not be immediately clear, the name "Pinniped" comes from Latin roots: "pinna," meaning fin or wing, and "ped," meaning foot. This name is fitting for this group of mammals, which includes seals, sea lions, and walruses, as they are characterized by their flipper-like limbs that function both as fins for swimming and as feet for moving on land.
74 True ['Narita'] I believe you are asking about the express train that connects Tokyo to Narita International Airport. The train line that provides this service is called the Narita Express (N'EX) or just "Narita Express." It is a limited express train that runs between Tokyo Station and Narita International Airport.
75 True ['Martinique'] Fort-de-France is the capital city of the French department and island of Martinique, located in the Caribbean Sea. Martinique is an overseas region and territory of France, enjoying a high degree of autonomy within the French Republic.
76 True ['Dierks Bentley'] The country song 'Drunk on a Plane' was sung by Dierks Bentley. Despite having the initials 'D.B.', Dierks Bentley is not short for Daniel Bentley as some might assume. His full name is actually Dierks Bradley Bentley.
77 True ['Olympus'] I'm glad you're interested in fitness and space exploration! However, I must clarify that as of now, there are no known fitfluencer activities or opportunities on Mars. Additionally, climbing the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars, is not currently possible for humans or influencers due to the lack of infrastructure and extreme conditions on the planet. Olympus Mons is the largest volcano and the largest shield volcano in the solar system, with a height of approximately 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) and a base diameter of about 37 miles (60 kilometers). It would be an incredible challenge even for the most fit and experienced climbers, as the thin Martian atmosphere provides little protection from the harsh radiation and temperature extremes. For now, we can only dream and train for such an adventure!
78 True ['Groundlings'] In the hierarchical seating arrangement at the Globe Theatre during Shakespeare's time, the lowest price for admission would correspond to the standing room in the pit, which was typically occupied by the groundlings. This term refers to commoners or laborers who could afford only the most affordable tickets. The groundlings were an 'earthy' group in the sense that they represented the working class and the general public. However, it's essential to note that the term 'earthy' in this context is not directly related to environmental or ecological groups, but rather refers to the social and economic standing of the people.
79 True ['Austria'] Austria

Josef Kaiser designed the 1 Euro coin for Austria, not for the European Union as a whole. The obverse side of the coin features a large, stylized representation of the Austrian coat of arms, while the reverse side displays a map of Europe with Austria highlighted. This design was used from 1995 to 2001.
80 True ['November Rain'] The quote "Nothing Lasts Forever, Even Heaven and Hell" is a lyric from the song "November Rain" by Guns N' Roses, which is not directly related to a specific month. The title of the song, however, does mention the month of November. So, if you're looking for a connection between Axl Rose's lyrics and a month, November would be the answer.
81 False ['Kerry'] The politician described in the memoir "Every Day is Extra" is Harold Evans. Although Evans did not serve in the Vietnam War, he did serve in the British Army during the Malayan Emergency. He is a five-term Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom and was a newspaper editor before moving to the United States, where he served as the Secretary of State of New York under Governor Mario Cuomo. Evans wrote the memoir to reflect on his life after being diagnosed with a terminal illness.
82 True ['Viviparous'] The word you're looking for is "Viviparous." Viviparous animals are those that give birth to live young, as opposed to laying eggs and having the young hatch outside the body.
83 True ['Azerbaijan'] Baku is not the lowest national capital in the world. The record for the lowest national capital is held by San Cristobal, the capital city of the Bolivian department of Nor Yungas, located at an elevation of approximately 1,414 meters (4,636 feet) above sea level. Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, is located at an elevation of approximately 28 meters (92 feet) above sea level.
84 True ['Flubber'] The super bouncy stuff from Disney's 1961 film "The Absent-Minded Professor" is called "Flubber." This elastic substance was the center of the story, and it gained renewed popularity when a remake of the film titled "Flubber" was released in 1997, starring Robin Williams.
85 True ['Quiet Desperation'] In "Walden," Henry David Thoreau wrote, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." This means that many people go through their days feeling unfulfilled, unsatisfied, and hopeless, despite appearing outwardly normal and content. They may be trapped in jobs they dislike, living in ways that do not align with their values, or feeling disconnected from their communities and the natural world. Thoreau believed that people needed to break free from these patterns and live more intentionally and authentically in order to find true happiness and fulfillment.
86 True ['Marlow'] The character you are referring to is Marlow from Joseph Conrad's novel "Heart of Darkness." Marlow travels up the Congo River in Central Africa to meet the mysterious and reclusive Kurtz, who has reportedly committed atrocities against the local people. Along the way, Marlow encounters various horrors and begins to question the morality and motives of Western civilization. The famous line, "The horror! The horror!" is spoken by Marlow as he recounts the events leading up to Kurtz's demise.
87 True ['Gallium'] I'm glad you're interested in science and technology! However, I must clarify that there is no real-life mini robot or material that can shape-shift like the T-1000 from the Terminator 2: Judgment Day movie. The T-1000's ability to transform its shape is a work of fiction.

As for the element with the symbol Ga, it is Gallium, a metal with a low melting point. Gallium melts at around 29.76°C (85.55°F), making it one of the lowest melting point metals. However, it doesn't have any shape-shifting properties.
88 False ['Fancy Free'] The first ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins with the title ending with "ree" and centered around three sailors is indeed "On The Town." This ballet premiered in 1944 and was inspired by the 1940 Broadway musical of the same name. The story follows three sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City and their romantic encounters with various women.
89 True ['Justinian'] The 6th century outbreak of Bubonic Plague that nearly killed Emperor Justinian I and devastated the Byzantine Empire is referred to as the Justinian Plague. This devastating pandemic is considered one of the most significant events in world history, as it spread across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, causing widespread death and social upheaval. The plague is believed to have originated in the eastern Mediterranean around 541 AD and lasted for several centuries. Emperor Justinian I, who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 527 to 565 AD, was one of the most prominent figures of the time, and his reign was marked by numerous military campaigns, legal reforms, and architectural achievements. However, the Justinian Plague left a deep impact on his empire and the world, shaping the course of history in profound ways.
90 True ['Pensacola'] The Spanish expedition you're referring to is likely the one led by Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano, which established a short-lived settlement called San Miguel de Guadalquivir de los Sueños de Santa Rosa (St. Miguel of Guadalquivir of the Rosary Dreams) near present-day Pensacola, Florida, in 1559. The settlement lasted for approximately two years before being abandoned due to various hardships, including hostile Native American tribes and harsh weather conditions.
91 True ['Avogadro'] The Italian physicist who contributed significantly to the understanding of the relationship between the pressure, volume, and number of molecules in a gas was Amadeo Avogadro. His most famous contribution to science is Avogadro's Law, which states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules, provided that the gases are identical. This law is a fundamental concept in the field of chemistry and is essential for understanding the behavior of gases.
92 True ['Tequila'] The correct answer to your question is "Tequila" by The Champs. This iconic instrumental hit, which reached the top of the Billboard charts in 1958, features a prominent saxophone riff and its title is the only lyric in the song, repeated numerous times. The title refers to the Mexican liquor, tequila.
93 True ['August Strindberg'] The Swede you are referring to is August Strindberg, and the collection of stories you mentioned is called "Giftas" in Swedish, which translates to "Married" in English. However, Strindberg was not persecuted for blasphemy specifically because of this collection. Instead, his works, including "Married," were criticized for their naturalistic and often controversial portrayals of marriage and relationships. Strindberg's writings were seen as challenging the social norms of the time and were considered offensive by some. Despite this, he continued to write and publish, becoming a leading figure in Swedish literature.
94 False ['Freebooter'] I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The term "Free" in the name of a pirate shoe does not refer to a specific type of pirate shoe being free of cost. Instead, the term "Free" could be a part of a pirate shoe brand name or a descriptive term for a particular feature of the shoe. For instance, "Free-Sole" pirate shoes might refer to shoes with a sole that is not attached to the upper part of the shoe, allowing greater flexibility. Without more context, it's impossible to determine the exact meaning of "Free" in the name of a pirate shoe.
95 True ['Bhutan'] The world's highest unclimbed mountain is indeed Gangkhar Puensum, which stands at an impressive height of approximately 24,980 feet (7610 meters). This colossal peak is located in the northernmost part of Bhutan, a country nestled between China and India, often referred to as the "Thunder Dragon Kingdom." Bhutan is renowned for its commitment to preserving its unique culture and natural environment, which has contributed to the mountain remaining unclimbed.
96 True ['Moravia'] Moravia

The preamble to the Czech Constitution mentions the historical territories of the Czech Republic as "the land of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia." Therefore, the missing region in your question is Moravia.
97 True ['Ampere', 'Ampère'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but the correct answer is not A.M.A. The base unit of electrical current in the International System of Units (SI) is named after André-Marie Ampère, a French physicist and mathematician. The unit of electrical current is named after him and is denoted as the ampere (A).
98 True ['Sphynx'] The breed of hairless cat that originated in Canada in the 20th century, with a kitten named Prune, is the Canadian Sphynx. Prune was born in 1966 in Toronto, and her unique appearance led to the development of this distinctive cat breed. The Canadian Sphynx is closely related to the American Sphynx, but it has some distinct differences, such as a more rounded head and a slightly different body shape.
99 True ['Vorpal Sword'] In Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland film, Alice does not actually use the phrase "Callooh! Callay!" when she slays the Jabberwocky. Instead, she uses a potion called "Jabberwocky juice" and a weapon called a "Vorpal sword." The phrase "Callooh! Callay!" is actually from Lewis Carroll's original poem "Jabberwocky," which Alice recites before she faces the creature.
100 True ['Vulgate'] St. Jerome is best known for his translation of the Bible into Latin, which is called the Vulgate (Latin for "common use") version. The Vulgate was the standard version of the Latin Bible used in the Western Church for centuries. The letter 'G' in the term "Vulgate" does not represent a middle 'G' but rather refers to the fact that this version of the Bible was in the "vulgar" or common language of the people, as opposed to the more formal or classical Latin used in other texts. Jerome completed the Vulgate around 405 AD.
101 True ['Eisenhower'] I'd be happy to help answer your question, but it seems there's a bit of confusion here. No U.S. president ever increased the minimum wage to $1. The minimum wage in the United States has always been set above that amount. As of 2021, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

Regarding the St. Lawrence Seaway, that project was indeed approved and opened during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower. The St. Lawrence Seaway is a series of locks and canals that connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, allowing large ships to travel between the two bodies of water. The seaway was officially opened on November 23, 1959.
102 True ['Bret Easton Ellis'] Bret Easton Ellis

The novel "Less Than Zero" is written by American author Bret Easton Ellis. It was published in 1985 and is known for its portrayal of the materialistic and apathetic lifestyles of wealthy youth in Los Angeles during the 1980s. The story follows the protagonist, Clay, as he returns home for the holidays from his college education and becomes reacquainted with his friends and their self-destructive behaviors.
103 True ['Kent'] The white cliffs of Dover are located in the county of Kent in England. These iconic cliffs, which are recognized for their striking white color and impressive height, have long been a symbol of England and its proximity to Europe across the English Channel.
104 True ['Florence Pugh'] Florence Pugh is a British actress known for her roles in films like "Don't Worry Darling," "Little Women," and "Midsommar." Toby Sebastian is her older brother. They have both appeared in various British television shows, but Toby is best known for his roles in "Game of Thrones" and "Marco Polo."
105 False ['Ha Ha'] How about "Burr-dable Fence" or "Monty's Moo-tion Maker"? These playful names suggest a fence that has "gone to ground" or sunken, and also allude to Monticello's famous owner, Thomas Jefferson, who was known for his agricultural pursuits and his beloved farm animals.

The actual name for a sunk fence is typically just described as a "sunk fence" or a "sunken fence." These types of fences were commonly used in colonial America to keep livestock out of gardens and fields, and they were often made from wooden rails set into the ground. Monticello, Jefferson's estate in Virginia, is known to have had several sunk fences to help manage the property's boundaries.
106 True ['Venerate'] The word you're looking for is "Veneration." It comes from the Latin word "venerare," which means "to venerate, to honor, to revere, or to worship." It's a strong feeling of respect and admiration for someone or something. Love is a broad term that can encompass many different emotions and feelings, but veneration specifically refers to the deep reverence and respect we have for something or someone.
107 True ['Flagella', 'Flagellum', 'Flagellin'] The parts of a bacterial cell that provide motility longer than cilia are flagella. Flagella are thin, whip-like structures that rotate like a propeller, enabling the bacterium to move through its environment. Unlike cilia, which are short, hair-like structures that move in a coordinated wave-like motion, flagella are longer and allow for more efficient and independent movement. Bacteria can have one or more flagella, and the rotation of the flagella can change direction, allowing the bacterium to change direction as needed.
108 True ['Bill Hodges'] The second book in the "Bill Hodges Trilogy" by Stephen King, following "Mr. Mercedes" (2014), is "Finders Keepers" (2015). The third book in the series is "End of Watch" (2016). These novels feature the retired detective Bill Hodges and his encounters with a psychopathic killer named Brady Hartsfield.
109 False ['Manila'] The correct answer is "Leatherneck Man." John Basilone, a Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, earned this nickname for his service with the U.S. Marine Corps in the Philippines during the 1930s. The term "Leatherneck" is a historical nickname for Marines, originating from the leather collar of their early uniforms.
110 True ['Io'] I'm glad you're interested in space exploration! However, I must clarify that as of now, there's no definitive evidence of ongoing volcanic activity on any of Jupiter's moons based on infrared images alone. The Juno spacecraft did capture some intriguing infrared data on Io, the most volcanically active moon in our solar system, but it didn't reveal any new volcanic activity. The infrared glow you might be thinking of could be due to Io's extensive sulfur dioxide geysers and lava flows, which do emit infrared radiation. So, while Io is indeed the moon of Jupiter that is most famously known for its volcanic activity, the latest infrared image from Juno doesn't necessarily show anything new in that regard.
111 False ['NewsRadio'] The 1990s sitcom where Phil Hartman voiced the character Bill McNeal was "The Simpsons." However, Bill McNeal was not part of the regular Springfield cast but rather the announcer for the fictional radio station, WNYX. This character made his first appearance in the episode "Lisa's Substitute" from the fifth season.
112 False ['hermeneutics'] The correct answer is "exegetes" or "exegetes tosists," but since you're asking for a plural word in English that is derived from the Greek word for "interpreter," the answer would be "interpreters." However, it's essential to note that the branch of theology dealing with the interpretation of biblical texts is called "Biblical Exegesis" or "Exegetical Theology." Interpreters are the individuals who engage in this process.
113 True ['Pascal'] Blaise Pascal is the Frenchman you are referring to. He did not invent a computer program, but he did design and build an early mechanical calculator, which is considered an ancestor of the modern electronic calculator and computers. This calculator, called the Pascaline, was completed in 1642. It could perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition and subtraction.
114 True ['Colleen Hoover'] The woman author who recently took the top two spots on the paperback trade fiction list with "It Ends with Us," "It Starts with Us," and "Heart Bones" is Colleen Hoover. These novels have been successful commercial hits, and Hoover's writing continues to resonate with readers.
115 False ['Rhode Island'] Jackie and JFK (John F. Kennedy) were not married at St. Mary's Church near Hammersmith Farm. This misconception likely arises from the fact that Jacqueline Bouvier, who later became Jackie Kennedy, did visit St. Mary's Church in Richmond, Virginia, with her family in 1941. However, she did not marry JFK there. St. Mary's Church in Richmond, Virginia, is in the state of Virginia.
116 True ['Stalingrad'] The city where two of the Nazi armies surrendered to the Red Army during the Battle of Stalingrad on February 2, 1943, is Stalingrad. This significant victory marked a major turning point in the Eastern Front during World War II.
117 False ['Karma Chameleon'] Boy George did not sing "You come and go, you come and go" in an Animal House hit song. Animal House is a 1978 film, and the song "You Come and Go" is from Boy George's 1983 solo album, "Dreamlover."
118 True ['Hagiography'] The word you're looking for is "biography." Although it doesn't directly end with the letter 'Y,' the term "hagiography" is sometimes used specifically for the writing of saints' lives. However, hagiography is a type of biography, focusing on the sanctity and miracles of the subject.
119 True ['Potsdam'] The city of Potsdam, Germany, was once the residence of the Electors of Brandenburg and later became the site of the Potsdam Conference towards the end of World War II. This significant diplomatic meeting took place between the leaders of the Allied powers, including Winston S. Churchill of the United Kingdom, Harry S. Truman of the United States, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, from July 17 to August 2, 1945. The conference aimed to shape the post-war world and establish the ground rules for the occupation of Germany and the eventual peace treaty.
120 False ['Francis Bacon'] The 17th century Essayist and Lord Chancellor of England with the same first and last name as the 20th century painter you mentioned is not known. The painter Wytze Hübner Tsjallinga, who painted "Head of a Woman (Lisa Sainsbury)" was born in 1923, and the 17th century figure you're thinking of is most likely Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who was born in 1600. Clarendon was a historian, statesman, and Lord Chancellor of England, but he did not share the same name with any notable painter from the same time period.
121 False ['Calypso'] I apologize for the confusion in your question. Odysseus, the legendary Greek hero from Homer's epic poem "The Odyssey," does not have a recorded encounter with a nymph named Angelica Kauffmann or any other nymph sharing a name with a music style. Angelica Kauffmann (1741-1807) was an influential Swiss painter active during the late Baroque and Rococo periods. Her works often depicted mythological scenes, but there is no known painting by her depicting Odysseus or his son being welcomed by a nymph named Angelica.
122 True ['The Thing'] The movie you're referring to is "The Thing" (1982), directed by John Carpenter. In this science fiction horror film, Kurt Russell plays MacReady, a helicopter pilot and one of the researchers at an Antarctic research station. They are terrorized by a shape-shifting alien that infiltrates their camp, taking the form of their colleagues and attempting to kill them. The paranoia and tension build as they try to identify and eliminate the creature before it eliminates them.
123 False ['Sir James Dewar'] This comic verse appears to be poking fun at the inability of the audience or the people being addressed as "asses" to match the supposed superiority of Sir James in the realm of science or magic, specifically in the ability to liquefy gases. Sir James is portrayed as being a superior individual due to this ability.
124 True ['Cold Open'] The opening sequence you're referring to in "Saturday Night Live" (SNL) is called the "cold open." It does not follow the format of two words with four letters each that precede the titles. The cold open is typically a sketch that airs before the show's titles and monologue, and it can be based on current events or a parody of a popular culture topic.
125 True ['Tom Jones'] I believe you're referring to the unexpected duet between Tom Jones and Jennifer Hudson on the song "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" during the blind auditions of the British singing competition "The Voice UK" in 2014. Tom Jones is a Welsh legend and a renowned singer, while Jennifer Hudson is an American R&B and soul singer. The duet went viral and received widespread acclaim for their powerful vocal performances. It was an unplanned moment during the auditions, making it even more special and memorable.
126 False ['Windward'] The passage due northwest of the west end of Hispaniola Island is the Mona Passage. It separates the Dominican Republic (Hispaniola Island) from Puerto Rico and the Mona Island, which is part of the Spanish Virgin Islands. There is no group of islands named the same way further southeast of Hispaniola. The islands southeast of Hispaniola include the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, and Cuba.
127 True ['Butler'] The novel "Kindred" by Octavia Butler tells the story of Dana, a young black woman who is mysteriously transported from her home in 1970s California to the pre-Civil War South, where she is enslaved on a plantation. Through this time travel, Dana experiences the horrors of slavery firsthand and is forced to make difficult choices to ensure her own survival and that of her white ancestor, Rufus, whose life is essential for her own existence in the present. The novel explores themes of race, identity, and the complexities of history.
128 False ['peristaltic', 'peristalsis'] Yes, during pregnancy, heartburn can be caused by the relaxation of the muscles in the digestive system, including the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This muscle normally acts as a barrier between the stomach and the esophagus, preventing stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus. However, during pregnancy, the LES may not function properly, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn.

Additionally, the growing uterus puts pressure on the stomach, making it harder for food to move from the stomach to the small intestine. This can also contribute to heartburn by keeping food in the stomach for a longer period of time.

Other factors that can contribute to heartburn during pregnancy include eating large meals, eating spicy or greasy foods, and lying down after eating. To help alleviate heartburn, pregnant women can try eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding trigger foods, and elevating the head of the bed while sleeping. If heartburn is severe or persistent, it's important to talk to a healthcare provider.
129 True ['The Unbearable Lightness of Being'] The novel you are referring to is "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Milan Kundera. In this novel, Tereza is a young woman who is in love with Tomas, a surgeon, who is having an affair with Sabina. The novel explores themes of love, morality, and the human condition in the context of the political and social upheaval in Czechoslovakia during the 1960s.
130 True ['endoskeleton'] The internal supporting structure of vertebrates is called the "skeletal system." However, if you're looking for a 12-letter long or longer word related to this concept, you might consider "endoskeleton." An endoskeleton is a type of internal skeleton found in most vertebrates, where the bones are located inside the body and form a framework that supports and protects the organs. Another option could be "vertebroskeleton," which is similar but includes the word "vertebrate" and is 13 letters long.
131 False ['Luminosity'] The astronomical term for "Mutiny Oils" that refers to a star's brightness is "Magnitude of Stars I." However, this is not an anagram as the letters do not form a different word when rearranged. The term "magnitude" itself is the astronomical term for brightness.
132 True ['Black Rebel Motorcycle Club'] The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (BRMC) is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco, California, in 1998. The name of the band is inspired by Marlon Brando's biker gang from the 1953 film "The Wild One." The band's members have stated that they were influenced by the film and the rebellious spirit of the biker gang portrayed in it.
133 True ['Yellen'] I cannot definitively answer that question as I don't have enough context to identify which specific successor of a president and ex-FED chair you are referring to. However, I can tell you that giving a high five is a friendly gesture often used to celebrate or acknowledge achievement. If you are referring to a person who has recently assumed a leadership role and has had some notable successes, then giving them a high five would be an appropriate way to acknowledge and celebrate their accomplishments.

One possible example could be Janet Yellen, who served as the Chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018 and was later appointed as the Secretary of the Treasury by President Joe Biden in 2021. If you have had the opportunity to meet her and she has achieved something noteworthy since becoming the Secretary of the Treasury, then giving her a high five would be a fitting way to acknowledge and celebrate her accomplishments.

Another example could be Donald Trump, who served as the President of the United States from 2017 to 2021 and was the Chair of the Executive Committee of Trump Organization before that. If you have had the opportunity to meet him and he has achieved something noteworthy since leaving the White House, then giving him a high five would be a fitting way to acknowledge and celebrate his accomplishments.

However, it's important to note that high fives are typically given in a friendly and celebratory context, and it's always important to consider the appropriateness of the gesture in any given situation. If you're unsure whether a high five would be an appropriate way to acknowledge someone's accomplishments, it's always a good idea to err on the side of caution and consider other, more formal ways of expressing congratulations or acknowledgment.
134 True ['Auricle'] The correct answer is that animals' ears are called "ears." The parts of the heart with a similar name are called "auricles." However, the resemblance between the two is not based on a direct physical resemblance but rather on the Latin root word "auris," which means "ear." The auricles of the heart are shaped like small pouches or cups, and in ancient times, it was thought that the heart's contractions resembled the movements of the ears when an animal was attentively listening. Therefore, the name "auricles" was given to the heart's structures based on their association with the ear rather than a direct physical resemblance.
135 False ['Josef K'] The character you are describing sounds like Meir Kellner from Philip Roth's novel "American Pastoral." Meir is the son of the novel's protagonist, Seymour "Swede" Levov, a successful businessman and former athletic star. Meir had a seemingly perfect upbringing, but on his 30th birthday, he is arrested for planting a bomb at a post office. The bombing is part of Meir's newfound involvement in radical leftist politics, and his life takes a dramatic turn towards chaos and instability.

The Kafka-esque elements in the novel come from the way Meir's transformation is portrayed. He goes from being a normal, if somewhat troubled, young man to a violent and unpredictable revolutionary, seemingly without any explanation or warning. The novel explores themes of identity, disillusionment, and the fragility of the American Dream.

Overall, "American Pastoral" is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that deals with complex and timely issues in a way that is both emotionally resonant and intellectually challenging.
136 True ['Animorphs'] The book series you're thinking of is likely "Animorphs" by K.A. Applegate. In this series, five teenagers gain the ability to morph into animals and use these abilities to fight against an alien invasion. The first book in the series is "The Invasion" and was published in 1996.
137 True ['St. Lawrence Seaway'] The Welland Canal is a significant part of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is a 2,300-mile long navigation route connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The Seaway system, which includes the Welland Canal, allows large ships to bypass the dangerous and shallow waters of Niagara Falls and navigate between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The Seaway was completed in 1959 and has greatly increased the economic importance of the Great Lakes as a transportation hub.
138 True ['Richard Powers'] Richard Powers

"The Overstory" by Richard Powers is a novel that explores the interconnected lives of various characters, many of whom are connected to the Pacific Northwest timber industry. The novel partially sets the stage for the Pacific Northwest timber wars, a period of intense conflict between logging companies and environmental activists in the late 20th century. The timber wars are a significant backdrop to the novel's themes of ecology, interconnectedness, and the human relationship with nature.
139 True ['midships'] The word you're looking for is "midships." Midships refers to the central part of a ship, and during historical naval battles, this area was often the focus of intense fighting. However, it's important to note that "midships" is actually a singular term, and it doesn't have a plural form. If you're looking for a term that can refer to multiple areas of a ship, you might consider using "middleships," but this term is not commonly used in English. Instead, you could say "areas of the ship near the midship" or "central areas of the ship where fighting occurred."
140 True ['Maximilian'] Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor, is the correct answer. Mary of Burgundy received a diamond ring with the initial 'M' from Maximilian I as a symbol of their engagement in 1477. The ring was a popular representation of their shared monogram, which combined the initials of both their names, 'M' for Mary and 'M' for Maximilian.
141 True ['Formosa'] George Psalmanazar, a French imposter, gained notoriety in 18th century London by convincing many people that he was from Formosa, which was then the European name for Taiwan. He presented himself as a native of this island, claiming to speak its language and possessing unique knowledge about its customs and people. However, it is now known that Psalmanazar had no genuine connection to Taiwan whatsoever. His deception was exposed in 1704 when a clergyman named Francis Place revealed that Psalmanazar was actually a Frenchman. Despite this, Psalmanazar continued to tour Europe, presenting himself as a Taiwanese native until his death in 1763.
142 True ["Li'l Abner"] Al Capp is best known for creating the comic strip "Li'l Abner," which is set in the fictional town of Dogpatch. The comic strip debuted in 1934 and ran until 1977. Dogpatch is a rural, backwoods community populated by quirky and eccentric characters, including Li'l Abner, Daisy Mae, and Pappy. The strip is known for its satirical take on American folk culture and its use of puns and wordplay.
143 True ['Uzbekistan'] The seven countries whose names end with 'Stan' are: Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Among these, Azerbaijan is the one that comes last alphabetically.
144 False ['Worsted'] The answer to this riddle is "wool." Despite its unpleasant sound, wool is a high-quality fabric that is warm, durable, and versatile. It is made from the fibers of sheep and other animals, which are twisted and compacted to create a dense, textured material. Wool is often used to make suits, coats, and pleated skirts due to its ability to insulate, drape well, and maintain its shape.
145 True ['Boole'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but the English mathematician born in 1815 who is known for contributing significantly to various mathematical fields does not fit the description you provided. The person you're likely thinking of is George Boole (not born in 1815 but in 1815-1856), who is famous for his work on logic, particularly Boolean algebra. However, he did not introduce the concepts of algebra, logic, search, or operators as a whole; rather, he developed new ways of understanding and manipulating these concepts.
146 True ['Siegfried'] In the "Ring" cycle by Richard Wagner, the poem "The Death of Siegfried" was composed around 1851, not exactly in 1850. This poem is a prelude to the final opera of the cycle, "Götterdämmerung" (Twilight of the Gods). It describes the death of the heroic character Siegfried, who is slain by Hagen, instigated by the vengeful goddess Erda and the sorceress Brünnhilde.
147 False ['Tyrion Lannister'] The quote "We've had Vicious Kings and We've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot boy king" was spoken by Cersei Lannister, portrayed by Lena Headey, in the HBO series "Game of Thrones." The quote is from the fifth season, during a conversation with her brother Jaime Lannister (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), regarding their nephew King Tommen Baratheon (played by Dean-Charles Chapman).
148 True ['Havel'] Václav Havel, a prominent Czech playwright, philosopher, and politician, wrote the tragicomedy "Leaving" (originally titled "Ave Maria") in 2008. This was his first play since 1989, following his election as the President of Czechoslovakia and later the Czech Republic. The play drew from Havel's personal experiences and insights gained during his tenure in politics.
149 True ['Ghent'] The Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, was signed on December 24, 1814, in the Belgian city of Ghent. This treaty marked the end of the conflict without any decisive victories for either side. The war had primarily taken place in North America, particularly in the border regions between the United States and Canada. The signing of the treaty brought an end to the hostilities and paved the way for improved relations between the two nations.
150 True ['Parliament Hill'] The notables commemorated with statues on Ottawa Hill, specifically in Ottawa's Parliament Hill area, are former Canadian Prime Ministers John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson. Their statues are located in the Parliament Hill Precinct, near the Centre Block and the Peace Tower. These statues serve as a tribute to their significant contributions to Canadian politics and history.
151 True ['Electroconvulsive therapy'] Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a type of brain stimulation therapy that uses electric currents to induce a controlled seizure in order to treat certain mental health conditions, primarily severe depression and bipolar disorder that have not responded to other treatments. The exact mechanism by which ECT works is not fully understood, but it is believed to lead to changes in brain chemistry and structure that improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression and mania. It is important to note that ECT is a complex medical procedure that requires careful monitoring and administration by trained medical professionals.
152 True ['Dominican'] The Order referred to as the "Black Friars" is the Dominican Order. Dominican friars wear the black habit with a white scapular, which is the source of their popular nickname.
153 False ['Will and Grace', 'Will & Grace'] The TV sitcom that won a significant number of Emmy awards during its initial run from 1998 to 2006 and had a brief reboot before ending in 2020 is "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel." Although it is not a traditional sitcom, it is a comedy series that follows the life of a housewife in the late 1950s who discovers her stand-up comedy talent. The show has received critical acclaim and has won numerous Emmy awards, including for its lead actress, Rachel Brosnahan, and its writing.
154 True ['Axolotl'] The Axolotl is the Mexican salamander that starts with 'Ax' and takes its name from the Nahuatl word for "Water Monster." Axolotls are unique among salamanders as they retain their larval features throughout their entire lives, living in the Xochimilco lake complex near Mexico City.
155 False ['Sentience'] The correct answer is "A Mind's I: Exploration of Consciousness" by Daniel C. Dennett and Nicholas Humphrey. If you insert the letter "T" after the word "judge," the title becomes "A Mind's I: A Study of Consciousness in a Prison of Thought." However, this is not an actual book title. The correct title does not contain the word "prison" or any reference to a prison term. Apologies for any confusion.
156 False ['William Jennings Bryan'] The presidential campaign slogan "Let the people rule" was used by Theodore Roosevelt during his third-party campaign in 1912, after he had left the Republican Party. This campaign was known as the "Bull Moose" campaign. Roosevelt's belief in direct democracy and the importance of the common people in government was reflected in this slogan.
157 False ['Knowledge is Power'] The Latin phrase "Ipsa Scientia Potestas Est" translates to "Knowledge Itself is Power." Sir Francis Bacon is attributed to this quote, although there is no definitive evidence that he was the first to say it. The idea that knowledge equals power is a common theme in philosophy and literature.
158 True ['Suva'] The capital city of Fiji that has a 4-letter name and is home to the University of the South Pacific is Suva. However, it's important to note that Suva is the largest city in Fiji and has been the country's capital since its independence in 1970. The University of the South Pacific, which is the largest university in the Pacific region, is indeed located in Suva.
159 True ['Monsanto'] The first herbicide-resistant genetically modified crop was developed in collaboration between the biotechnology company Monsanto and the University of California, Berkeley. The herbicide in question was Roundup, which is manufactured by Monsanto. The first commercialized genetically modified crop was Roundup Ready soybeans, which were introduced in the United States in 1996. These crops were engineered to be resistant to Roundup, allowing farmers to use the herbicide more effectively to kill weeds while leaving the crops unharmed.
160 True ['Rothaniel'] I apologize for the confusion, but I cannot directly answer that question as I don't have access to Jerrod Carmichael's specific 2022 stand-up special or its title. However, I can tell you that during his stand-up performances, Jerrod Carmichael has shared personal stories about his life, relationships, and experiences. The title of his 2022 stand-up special is "Rothaniel," and in it, he discusses his upbringing, family, and other aspects of his life. The first name he mentions in the special is "Rothaniel," which is his middle name.
161 True ['Kyushu'] The sacred island of Okinoshima is located in the sea between the southern Japanese main island of Kyushu and the smaller island of Taketomi, which is part of the Okinawa Islands. Okinoshima is renowned for its ancient shrine and is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site is believed to have been an important stopover for maritime trade routes between China and Japan during ancient times.
162 True ['Rimsky-Korsakov'] The fifth member of "The Five" or "The Mighty Handful," who were prominent Russian composers of the late 19th century, primarily based in St. Petersburg, is Rimsky-Korsakov. Alongside Cui, Balakirev, Borodin, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov, other notable St. Petersburg composers of the Moscow School of Music, contemporary to Tchaikovsky, include:

1. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908)
2. Alexander Borodin (1828-1887)
3. Anatoly Lyadov (1855-1914)
4. Alexander Glazunov (1865-1936)
5. Nikolai Medtner (1880-1951)
6. Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915)

These composers, while not technically members of "The Five," were part of the same musical milieu and contributed significantly to the development of Russian classical music.
163 True ['Ming'] The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) is known for its renowned blue-and-white porcelain. However, it is a common misconception that they imported blue pigment from Prussia for this purpose. In fact, the blue pigment used in Ming porcelain was derived from cobalt, which was imported from Persia or Afghanistan. The confusion likely arises due to the later association of Prussian blue with Chinese porcelain in the 18th and 19th centuries when European manufacturers began producing imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain using Prussian blue pigment.
164 True ['Leguizamo'] The Latino actor you're referring to is John Leguizamo. He indeed starred in "Summer of Sam" and "Spawn," but his voice work as Bruno in "Encanto" has been widely recognized and celebrated. However, there have been some discussions about the representation of the Bruno character and Leguizamo's portrayal, leading to debates and criticisms.
165 True ['Thorazine', 'Chlorpromazine'] In the movie "Shutter Island" (2004, not 1954), the character played by Ben Kingsley, Dr. Cawley, does mention a new antipsychotic medication. However, the medication he mentions is Thorazine (Chlorpromazine), which was actually approved by the FDA in 1954, but it is an anachronism in the movie's setting since the story takes place in 1954, and Thorazine was not yet available at that time. This inconsistency is likely due to the creative liberties taken by the filmmakers for the sake of the narrative.
166 False ['Jungian'] The analysis you're referring to is called Analytical Psychology, and the psychologist whose name starts with "J" is Carl Gustav Jung. In his theory of Analytical Psychology, the anima is the inner feminine personality that exists in a man's unconscious. The anima represents the aspects of the feminine psyche that a man may project onto women in his life or may need to develop within himself for psychological balance.
167 True ['Giorgione'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but there isn't a well-known Venetian Renaissance painter with the name "Big George" or whose name means "Big George." The most famous Venetian painters from that period include Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, and Giorgione. Giorgione's name doesn't mean "Big George," but rather it's believed to be derived from a nickname or a place of origin.
168 True ['Wisconsin'] I apologize for any confusion, but there seems to be a mistake in the information provided. There is no known prehistoric cave named Samuel's cave in LaCrosse County, Wisconsin, or any other state, that has been extensively vandalized. If you have more specific information about a particular site, please let me know and I will do my best to help you.
169 True ['Highly Effective People'] The three words that complete the title of Stephen R. Covey's book "The 7 habits of ________?" are "highly effective people." So, the full title is "The 7 habits of Highly Effective People." I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
170 True ['linear accelerator'] A linear accelerator (linac) is a type of particle accelerator that uses an electromagnetic field to accelerate charged particles in a straight line, as opposed to the circular path used in cyclotrons or synchrotrons. In Menlo Park, California, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory operates the 2-mile long ALBA synchrolight source, which is not a linac but rather a synchrotron. However, the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, also located in Menlo Park, operates a famous 2-mile long linac that was once used to accelerate electrons to high energies for particle physics research. This linac was instrumental in making groundbreaking discoveries, such as the determination of the magnetic moment of the muon and the measurement of the fine structure constant with high precision.
171 True ['Criminal Minds'] Mr. Scratch is a villain who first appeared in season 10 of the CBS series "Criminal Minds." He is portrayed as a charismatic and manipulative serial killer who targets specific individuals and goes to great lengths to evade capture by the BAU team. Mr. Scratch, whose real name is Mateo Creighton, is known for his ability to disguise himself and blend in with society, making him a particularly challenging adversary for the team to apprehend.
172 False ["don't look a gift horse in the mouth", "don't check the mouth of a gift horse"] The Italian phrase "a cavallo donato non si guarda in bocca" can be translated to English as "A horse given is not looked in the mouth." This means that once a favor or gift has been received, one does not scrutinize or question it further. It is an expression used to describe a situation where one should not look a gift horse in the mouth, or examine its potential flaws too closely.
173 False ['Commonwealth of Nations'] The 1926 Balfour Report referred to the Jewish and Arab populations in Palestine, proposing a solution for the governance of Palestine after the end of British rule. The phrase "Equal in status, in no way subordinate to each other" describes the desired relationship between these two populations in the proposed solution. Therefore, the answer is "Jewish and Arab peoples."
174 True ['William Blake'] The work "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" was created by the English poet and artist William Blake. However, the exact year of its completion is a subject of debate among scholars, with some suggesting it was finished around 1790-1793, while others argue it could have been as late as 1800. This illuminated book is considered one of Blake's most influential works, featuring a series of vivid and intricate images accompanied by text. The title page of "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" displays Blake's distinctive artistic style and visionary imagination.
175 True ['Han'] The Han River

Seoul's Moonlight Rainbow Bridge Fountain is the world's largest bridge fountain, stretching an impressive 3,740 feet (1,140 meters). This engineering marvel recycles water from the Han River below for its dazzling displays. The Han River, which flows through South Korea's capital city, is a vital source of water for both industrial and residential use. The fountain's stunning light and water shows add to Seoul's vibrant nightlife and attract tourists from around the world.
176 True ['Finnish'] The European language where the double vowels "u:i:i" in the words for "fire" and "wind" are commonly found is Finnish. In Finnish, "tuli" means "fire," and "tuuli" means "wind."
177 True ['Prometheus'] The answer to your riddle is "Prometheus." In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. This act is often referred to as "Prometheus bringing fire to mankind." The phrase "it was lit" suggests a bright and lively atmosphere, which describes the situation before Prometheus was punished by Zeus. The punishment involved Prometheus being chained to a mountain, where an eagle would eat his liver every day only for it to regrow and be eaten again, an eternal torment. This period is referred to as "it got real dark," indicating a dark and ominous atmosphere.
178 False ['plethora'] The answer to the riddle is "plenus." However, please note that "plenus" is a Latin term, not Greek. The English word derived from it is "plenty," which is the word that fits the description of an overabundance in eight letters. So, the answer is "plenty."
179 True ['As you Like It'] The speech you are referring to is from Act 2, Scene 4 of William Shakespeare's play "As You Like It." The character who delivers this line is Duke Senior, and he is talking about his brother, Duke Frederick. Here is the full context of the speech:

Duke Senior:
I have been informed what a man I was,
What reverence I did deserve, by my birth;
But I have learned to a deeper secrecy:
For every man that shall be oppress'd,
And cry out to me, show me but a token,
And I'll redress him: but who's so beholden to me,
That I may with a clear conscience call him mine?
My brother Jaques keeps school, and report speaks goldenly
Of his profit: but what care I who learns my lesson?
I have a better way to tread a measure:
To be a man, and to be known in England.

So, Duke Senior is expressing his desire to help those who are oppressed and to be known as a good ruler, while also mentioning that his brother Jaques is doing well in his school.
180 False ['Oort'] The green comet that visited Earth in 2023 is a fictional event as no such comet occurred during that year. Comets are not typically described as green, and the names of comet clouds are not associated with specific astronomers. Comets are named based on the order of their discovery.
181 False ['Croesus'] The character in the 1696 play likely refers to being as rich as King Solomon, who was famously known for his wealth and wisdom in various proverbs. However, there isn't an exact quote from the play that matches this phrase. The idea of becoming extremely wealthy by obtaining a patent is a common theme in literature and history, and the reference to King Solomon is a proverbial way of expressing immense wealth.
182 True ['Germanicus'] The brother of Claudius and father of Caligula who campaigned near the Rhine is Germanicus. However, his nickname "Germanicus" did not originate from these campaigns. The name "Germanicus" means "relating to the Germans" and was given to him by Augustus as a mark of respect for his victories against the Germanic tribes. The most famous of his campaigns near the Rhine was the one in 16 AD, during which he successfully repelled an invasion by the Germanic Chatti and Marcomanni tribes.
183 True ['Parallax'] Parsec is not an international unit of length derived from a portmanteau of a word and "second." A parsec is actually a measure of distance, not length. One parsec is equal to approximately 3.26 light-years or 30.851 trillion kilometers. The name "parsec" comes from the parallax of one second of arc. In astronomy, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a nearby star against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. So, a parsec is the distance at which a star shows a parallax shift of one second of arc.
184 False ['Jason vs. Mrs. Doubtfire'] In this hypothetical crossover scenario, let's assume that Jason Voorhees from the "Friday the 13th" series takes on Mrs. Doubtfire, the iconic character portrayed by Robin Williams in the 1993 film of the same name. However, it's important to note that there's no direct connection between the two characters or stories.

Jason Voorhees is a relentless and seemingly indestructible serial killer, known for wearing a hockey mask and stalking and murdering his victims at Camp Crystal Lake. Mrs. Doubtfire, on the other hand, is a disguise used by Daniel Hillard, a divorced father who wants to spend more time with his children. He creates the Mrs. Doubtfire persona to get a job as a housekeeper in their home, and later uses it to spend time with them undetected.

If we were to compare their masks metaphorically, we could say that Jason's hockey mask represents his unyielding and terrifying nature, while Mrs. Doubtfire's disguise represents the deception and complexity of human emotions and desires. However, in a physical fight, Jason would have a clear advantage over Mrs. Doubtfire, as he is a supernatural killer with incredible strength and endurance, while Mrs. Doubtfire is just a disguise worn by a human being.

As for the cake moisturizer mentioned in the question, it's unclear how that would factor into this hypothetical crossover scenario. Mrs. Doubtfire does use various cosmetics and makeup to maintain her disguise, but there's no scene in the movie where she uses cake as a moisturizer. Jason, of course, has no use for cake moisturizer whatsoever.
185 False ['Library Paste'] The old 'L.P' you're referring to is likely "PVA Adhesive" or "Polyvinyl Acetate Adhesive," which is a type of white, thick, and water-soluble glue commonly used in bookbinding. It's often preferred for its strong bond, flexibility, and ability to withstand handling and aging. PVA adhesive is also known as "PVA Paste," "Bookbinding Glue," or "Methyl Cellulose Adhesive" in some contexts.
186 True ['Rime of the Ancient Mariner'] I believe you are referring to the poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In this poem, there are indeed stanzas with four lines each, but there is no single stanza with exactly nine lines. However, there is a stanza with nine lines that comes close, as it has two quatrains (four-line stanzas) followed by a three-line stanza:

In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It did descend or on the topmast spread its wing:
With sun or moon, or fair or foul,
It bore aloft on its back the pilot's freckled skin,
And as often as that pilot came in sight
He was welcomed by his fellow-sailors with delight.
He heaved down the hatchway-grating, flung the cable quick,
He took the helm, the good South-wind being now with him,
The sailors, all of them, gazing at him,
With pinned-back ears and open mouths,
Thus spake the Ancient Mariner:
"Heave to, my hearties! Make sail!
Let the great logan be
Cast forth!" (lines 363-375)

This stanza describes the appearance of the albatross, which is guided by the ancient mariner, and the sailors' reaction to it.
187 True ['Montserrat'] The volcanic island that Columbus named in the West Indies, which is currently under British rule, is Montserrat. Columbus discovered Montserrat in 1493, and the French briefly took control of the island during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, the British reclaimed Montserrat in 1783 and have maintained sovereignty over it since then.
188 True ['The Commitments'] The Barleylands or The Commitments are not Roddy Doyle's first novels, but they are indeed famous for being the basis of his novel and the subsequent movie of the same name. The Commitments, published in 1987, is actually Roddy Doyle's third novel. The story revolves around an imaginary soul band from Dublin, Ireland.
189 True ['101'] The legend you're referring to is about Carl Gauss, a famous mathematician, who is said to have quickly solved the task of summing the first 100 positive integers (also known as the sum of an arithmetic series) when he was a child. The story goes that his teacher gave him this task as a makework assignment, but Gauss is said to have finished it very quickly.

According to the legend, Gauss noticed that every pair of consecutive numbers from 1 to 100 can be represented as the sum of two integers: one number is always a multiple of 2, and the other is a number between the first number and the next multiple of 2. For example, the pair (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and so on.

So, the sum of each pair is the sum of two consecutive integers, which can be calculated as follows:

sum_of_pair = first_number + second_number

Since there are 50 pairs in the first 100 positive integers, we can find the sum of the first 100 positive integers by summing the sums of all 50 pairs:

sum_of_first_100_positive_integers = sum_of_pairs_1_to_50

To calculate the sum of the first 50 pairs, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

sum_of_series = (n * (first_number + last_number)) / 2

where n is the number of terms in the series.

In this case, the first number is 1, the last number is 100, and there are 50 pairs (or 51 terms, since the last term is also included in the sum).

So, the sum of the first 100 positive integers can be calculated as:

sum_of_first_100_positive_integers = (51 * (1 + 100)) / 2
sum_of_first_100_positive_integers = (51 * 101) / 2
sum_of_first_100_positive_integers = 5050

Therefore, the sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.
190 True ['Io'] The lover of Zeus who was turned into a cow is Io. In Greek mythology, Io was a beautiful priestess of Hera, Zeus's wife, who was seduced by Zeus in various forms to hide his infidelity. Hera, discovering their affair, punished Io by having Hermes transform her into a cow to hide her from Zeus's sight. Zeus, however, continued to visit Io in her cow form and she gave birth to a number of children, including Epaphus, who was fathered by Zeus. Eventually, Hera's vengeance against Io came to an end, and she was returned to her human form.
191 False ['Kim'] The novel you're referring to is "From Russia with Love" by Ian Fleming, but that's not quite an accurate description of the plot. The character you're thinking of is actually James Bond, who is not Irish or an orphan, and he is not trained in India for the British Secret Service to be a spy. Instead, in the novel "The Man with the Golden Gun," Bond goes to India to investigate a crime syndicate and encounters an Irish assassin named Frankenstein, but there's no extensive training involved.

The correct answer for the Irish orphan trained as a spy for the British Secret Service in India is actually Roger Quigley, the protagonist of Paul Theroux's novel "The Mosquito Coast." However, it's important to note that this novel is not related to the James Bond series.
192 False ['Rum Runner'] Bill McCoy was an American Prohibition-era bootlegger who is famous for the high quality of the liquor he sold. The term "the real McCoy" is believed to have originated from McCoy's operation, meaning that something is authentic or genuine. McCoy's liquor was so highly regarded that it became a benchmark for other bootleggers to aspire to. The phrase is still used today to mean something that is of the highest quality or the genuine article.
193 True ['Iron Chancellor'] Otto von Bismarck is often referred to as "The Iron Chancellor." The nickname "Iron" highlights his tough and pragmatic approach to politics and governance. The title "Chancellor" refers to his position as the head of the German imperial government from 1871 to 1890.
194 True ['Hamilton'] Laird Hamilton is the surfer featured in the documentary 'Riding Giants' who is married to volleyball star Gabrielle Reece. Laird Hamilton is a renowned big wave surfer known for his expertise in riding massive waves. The documentary chronicles the history of big wave surfing and Hamilton's significant contributions to the sport. Gabrielle Reece is a professional volleyball player and an accomplished actress. The couple married in 1997.
195 True ['Machu Picchu'] The local guide Melchor Arteaga led Hiram Bingham to the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu in 1911, not Vilcabamba. Machu Picchu was believed to be a lost city at the time, although it had been inhabited continuously by local Quechua people since the Spanish conquest. Vilcabamba, on the other hand, was the last refuge of the Inca resistance against the Spanish conquerors and is located in a different region of Peru.
196 True ['Manolo Blahnik'] The Spanish shoe designer renowned for his stilettos who created shoes for Sofia Coppola's film "Marie Antoinette" is Manolo Blahnik. His exquisite footwear designs have been a favorite among fashion enthusiasts and celebrities alike, making him an ideal choice for the period film set in the opulent world of the French court.
197 True ['Aruba'] The Dutch island where you would find a colorful Dutch Colonial style building in Oranjestad is Aruba. This charming town is the administrative and economic heart of Aruba, an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, located in the Caribbean Sea. Its Dutch colonial architecture, vibrant colors, and rich history make it a popular tourist destination.
198 False ['Solarization'] The photographic effect you're looking for is "negative." A negative image is one where the tones are reversed - the highlights in the original scene become dark areas in the negative, and the shadows become light areas. This is the result of the traditional photographic process, where light-sensitive silver halide crystals in a photographic emulsion are exposed to light and then chemically developed to produce an image. The term "negative" comes from the fact that the image produced is the inverse of the original scene. However, it's important to note that digital images can also be manipulated to produce a negative effect, without the need for any physical photographic process.
199 True ['Bartleby'] The title you're looking for is "Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Tale of Wall-Building." In this short story by Herman Melville, the protagonist, Bartleby, is an office worker who initially seems apathetic and inefficient, but later refuses to perform any task that he deems "hateful." The metaphor of walls appears throughout the story, with Bartleby famously working in a room with brick walls and later being confined to a prison cell with high walls.
200 True ['Quincy Jones'] Quincy Jones, a renowned American record producer, composer, and film producer, was not diagnosed with an aneurysm that required him to quit using the name "Trumpt." Quincy Jones is known for producing the charity single "We Are the World," which was released in 1985. The song was a collaboration between several popular artists of the time, including Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, and Tina Turner, among others. Jones' health issues have not included an aneurysm that forced him to abandon the name "Trumpt."
201 True ['Tikrit'] The information provided in the question is incorrect. Saddam Hussein was not born near a city starting with 'T' on the west bank of the Tigris in 1937. He was actually born in the village of Al-Awja, which is located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) north of Baghdad, the capital city of Iraq.

Saddam Hussein was not pulled out of the ground in 2003, either. He was captured by U.S. forces on December 13, 2003, in ad-Dawr, a rural area near Tikrit, which is a city in northern Iraq. Tikrit is not on the west bank of the Tigris, but it is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River.
202 True ['Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'] The movie you're referring to is "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter." In this film, Benjamin Walker portrays the title role, depicting Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter in an alternate history where vampires have been a part of American society since its inception.
203 True ['Jemison'] Mae Jemison is the first African-American woman to travel in space. She flew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on September 12, 1992, as a mission specialist. However, it's important to note that Nichelle Nichols, who played Lt. Uhura in Star Trek, inspired many people, including Mae Jemison, to pursue careers in science and space exploration.
204 True ['Belshazzar'] The ruler mentioned in the Book of Daniel as the father of Belshazzar, who was allegedly present during the events described in Daniel 5, is not entirely accurate according to historical records. The Book of Daniel incorrectly identifies Belshazzar as a son of Nebuchadnezzar II, but in reality, Belshazzar was most likely Nebuchadnezzar's son-in-law and the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

The actual ruler who was killed during the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C. was Cambyses II, the king of the Achaemenid Empire (Persia), not Belshazzar of Babylon. Cambyses II led the Persian forces that conquered Babylon and put an end to the Neo-Babylonian Empire. This historical discrepancy between the Book of Daniel and actual historical records is a common theme in the biblical text and has been a subject of much debate among scholars.
205 True ['Martin McDonagh'] Martin McDonagh, the playwright whose work was featured on the opening night of "The Cripple of Inishmaan," has recently directed a movie titled "The Banshees of Inisheer." However, it's important to note that this film is not directly related to his play "The Cripple of Inishmaan." Instead, it's a separate project that also explores Irish folklore and supernatural elements.
206 True ['Mohs'] Talc is not listed on any commonly used scale that measures the resistance of a smooth surface to scratching with a numerical value of 1 as the least resistant. The Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness is a well-known scale that ranks minerals based on their hardness and resistance to scratching, but it does not include talc as having a value of 1. Talc is a soft mineral with a Mohs hardness of 1, but it is not the softest substance on this scale. The softest substances, such as graphite and wax, are not minerals and are not included on the Mohs Scale. Therefore, there is no definitive answer to your question.
207 False ['White Noise'] I apologize for the error in my previous response. The Airborne Toxic Event is actually named after a short story, not a novel, by Don DeLillo. The title of the short story is "The Airborne Toxic Event," which was first published in Esquire magazine in 1984. The band took its name from this title, and it does not have a direct connection to any of DeLillo's novels. There is no novel by DeLillo that shares this name, and there was no movie based on it in 2022.
208 True ['Karnak'] The temple complex on the right bank of the Nile that occupies part of the site of ancient Thebes is the Temple of Luxor. This ancient Egyptian temple is dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu. It was built mostly during the New Kingdom, particularly during the reigns of Pharaohs Amenhotep III, Ramses II, and Tutankhamun. The Temple of Karnak, located just a few kilometers north, is the larger and more famous temple complex, but Luxor Temple is equally impressive and worth exploring.
209 False ['Dan Rostenkowski'] The Illinois politician who went from power in the U.S. House to prison in the 1990s is former Congressman Mel Reynolds. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995 representing Illinois's 1st congressional district. In 1995, he was indicted on 12 counts, including sexual assault, obstruction of justice, and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission. He was later convicted on several charges and served time in prison.
210 False ['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'] I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Mario Vargas Llosa did not give any other South American Nobel laureates a literal black eye in 1976 or any other year. This is a misconception that has been circulating for some time. There is no evidence to support this claim.
211 True ['Kepler'] Johannes Kepler

Johannes Kepler, a renowned German mathematician and astronomer, succeeded Tycho Brahe as the Imperial Mathematician after Tycho's death in 1601. Kepler worked as an assistant to Tycho for several years before Tycho's demise and inherited a significant portion of his astronomical instruments and data, which he used to make groundbreaking discoveries, such as the elliptical shape of planetary orbits around the sun.
212 True ['Philip Glass'] I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The correct answer is that the composer who created "A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close" is Philip Glass, not the other way around. Philip Glass composed the music for this piece inspired by Chuck Close's painting "Phil."
213 True ['Dangerous Liaisons'] The Starz prequel TV show that depicts the younger Marquise De Merteuil and Vicomte De Valmont from a novel of romantic intrigue is "The Affair of the Poisons" (also known as "The Serpent Queen"). This series is a prequel to "Dangerous Liaisons" and is based on the historical account of the Poisons Affair in 17th century France. The show explores the lives of the infamous characters, Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, before they met and became the master manipulators of seduction and revenge as portrayed in "Dangerous Liaisons."
214 True ['polyglot'] The word you're looking for is "Polyglot." A polyglot is an individual who can speak many languages.
215 True ['China'] The Misty Poets were a group of Chinese poets who emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s during the Cultural Revolution in China. The term "Misty Poets" was coined to describe their poetry, which was characterized by its introspective, melancholic, and surreal themes, as well as its departure from the rigid ideological constraints of socialist realism that were favored by the Chinese Communist Party at the time.

The Misty Poets were not a formal organization, but rather a loosely connected group of poets who shared similar artistic sensibilities. Some of the most prominent Misty Poets include Ai Qing, Duanmu Hongliang, Jiangwen, Liu Shaoming, and Zang Huang.

Despite the challenges posed by the Cultural Revolution, which saw the suppression of intellectual and artistic expression, the Misty Poets continued to write and publish their work, often doing so in underground circles or abroad. Their poetry helped to pave the way for the modern Chinese literary scene and influenced later generations of Chinese writers.
216 True ['Wings'] The first Best Picture Oscar was awarded in 1929 for the film "Wings," which is not directly about World War I pilots, but rather tells the story of two young men who become pilots and compete for the affections of the same woman. The film does include some World War I action, as it was released just a few years after the end of the war. "Wings" is considered a landmark in the history of cinema, as it was the first film to win the Best Picture award and also set a record for the highest grossing silent film of all time.
217 True ['Bearer Bond', 'Bearer Bonds'] In banking, the abbreviation "B.B." refers to Bearer Bonds. A Bearer Bond is a type of bond that does not have a registered owner. Instead, the person in possession of the physical certificate serves as the owner. The interest payments and the principal amount are payable to whoever holds the certificate at the time of payment. This makes Bearer Bonds an anonymous form of debt security, as the identity of the owner is not recorded with the issuer.
218 False ['Superannuated'] The term you're looking for is "Annuus," which is Latin for "belonging to or having a duration of one year." While it's not a common synonym for "obsolete" in everyday language, it can be used in specific contexts to mean something that is one year old or outdated. However, it's important to note that "annus" itself does not directly mean "obsolete." Instead, it provides a historical context for understanding the origin of the term "obsolete," which comes from the Latin "obsoletus," meaning "worn out" or "out of use."
219 True ['V.S. Naipaul'] V.S. Naipaul, not Derek Walcott, was the Trinidad-born author who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001. Naipaul's novel "A House for Mr. Biswas" was published in 1961.
220 True ['Eris'] The dwarf planet named for the Greek goddess of strife is Eris. Eris was discovered in 2005, and it is slightly larger than Pluto, making it the second-largest known dwarf planet in our solar system (after Pluto itself). Eris and Pluto share similar sizes and orbits, both being located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.
221 True ['Bismarck'] The Admiralty Islands were under German control along with other islands in the South Pacific region known as Micronesia, specifically the Bismarck Sea and the Solomon Sea. This period of German control, known as the German Protectorate of Micronesia, lasted from around 1884 to 1914. The German presence in the Pacific was part of a larger imperialist expansion by European powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
222 True ['Samuel Beckett'] The Irish playwright who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969 and wrote in both English and French was Samuel Beckett. Beckett was known for his innovative and experimental works in both languages, including plays like "Waiting for Godot" and "Endgame." His bilingual abilities allowed him to reach wider audiences and explore the nuances of language in his writing.
223 True ['Topkapi'] The museum you're referring to is the Istanbul Military Museum, also known as the "Topkapı Sarayı Kanuni Sultanı Mehmet Anapları Kapısı" in Turkish. This name translates to "Cannon Gate of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror at Topkapi Palace." It was indeed built by Sultan Mehmed II, who ruled from 1451 to 1481. The museum is located within the historic Topkapi Palace complex in Istanbul, Turkey. It houses a vast collection of military artifacts, including weapons, uniforms, and documents, dating from the Ottoman Empire's founding in the late 13th century up to the early 20th century.
224 True ['Murmansk'] There is no Russian port with unrestricted access to the Atlantic that is located north of the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle is approximately at 66°33' N latitude, and the Atlantic Ocean is to the west of Europe and North America, with no Russian ports north of this latitude having direct access to it. The largest city north of the Arctic Circle is Murmansk, Russia, which is located on the Barents Sea, north of the Arctic Circle but not directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean.
225 False ['The Triplets of Belleville', 'Les Triplettes de Belleville'] The title trio of musically gifted sisters from the 2003 French film "Les Sages Femmes" (English title: "The Wise Women") are named Pauline, Adèle, and Léocadia. However, this film does not involve a kidnapped cyclist being rescued. The correct film for that description is "Fanfaron" (2003) by Cédric Klapisch, which features a trio of sisters named Pauline, Adèle, and Léocadie, who help rescue a kidnapped man.
226 True ['Zanzibar'] Zanzibar is the Tanzanian island where Sultan Khalid Bin Barghash ruled for about two days and waged a short war against the British Empire in 1896. Khalid Bin Barghash was the last independent ruler of Zanzibar before it became a British protectorate. He ascended to the throne after the death of his father, Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini, in 1896.

The British, who had long-standing commercial and political interests in Zanzibar, saw Khalid Bin Barghash as a threat due to his pro-German leanings. The British government had issued an ultimatum demanding that Khalid Bin Barghash sign a treaty recognizing British suzerainty over Zanzibar. Khalid refused to sign the treaty and instead declared jihad against the British.

The resulting conflict, known as the Zanzibar War or the Anglo-Zanzibar War, lasted for just over 38 minutes on August 27, 1896. The British, who were better armed and had more modern warships, quickly defeated the Zanzibar navy and landed troops on the island. Khalid Bin Barghash fled to Stone Town, the old part of Zanzibar City, but was soon captured and exiled to Seychelles.

Zanzibar became a British protectorate, and the sultanate came to an end. Khalid Bin Barghash is remembered in Tanzanian history as a brave and defiant ruler who fought against foreign domination.
227 True ['Luanda'] The capital city and chief seaport of Angola is called Luanda. It is the most populous city in Angola and is located on the Atlantic Ocean coast in the western part of the country. Luanda serves as the political and economic center of Angola.
228 True ['Oliver Cromwell'] The person who reportedly described the execution of King Charles I as a "Cruel Necessity" was Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1653 to 1658. Cromwell played a key role in the English Civil War and the subsequent overthrow of the monarchy. He was a Puritan and a military leader who believed that the execution of the king was necessary to put an end to the tyranny and instability caused by Charles I's rule. However, it's important to note that the term "Cruel Necessity" was not used in an official capacity or in a written document by Cromwell, but rather in a speech given by his son Richard Cromwell after his father's death. The exact words and context of the speech are a subject of debate among historians.
229 False ['Allocution'] The term you're looking for is a "defense statement" or "mitigation speech." This is not directly related to the root of the word "Eloquent," but rather to the legal process.

In a criminal trial, after the jury has delivered its verdict and the judge has revoked the defendant's bail, the defendant is given an opportunity to address the court before sentencing. During this speech, the defendant may express remorse for their actions, provide an explanation for their behavior, or present evidence or arguments in mitigation of their sentence. The goal is to provide the judge with any relevant information that might influence the sentence, such as the defendant's background, circumstances surrounding the offense, or the impact of the sentence on the defendant and their family.

The defendant's speech during this time is often referred to as being "eloquent" if it is well-spoken, persuasive, and effective in conveying their message to the judge. However, the term "eloquent" itself does not have a specific legal meaning in this context. It is simply a descriptive term used to denote effective and persuasive communication.
230 True ['Lester Bangs'] I apologize for any confusion, but the character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Almost Famous," named Lester Bangs, was actually a real-life rock critic. He wrote for various music publications, including Creem and Rolling Stone, and was known for his passionate and often controversial writing style.

However, there is no book called "Let it Blurt" that is about Lester Bangs. The title "Let it Blurt" is actually the name of a collection of Lester Bangs' writings, which was published posthumously in 1976. The book was edited by Greil Marcus and includes many of Bangs' most famous pieces on artists such as Iggy Pop, The Rolling Stones, and The Who.

So, while Lester Bangs did write about Blondie, there is no book called "Let it Blurt" that is specifically about him or Blondie.
231 False ['Elmore Leonard Nimoy'] The name you are looking for is Elmore Leonard, who wrote the Gritty "Get Shorty" novel, and Leonard Nimoy, who is known for his role as Spock in the Star Trek franchise and famously said "Live Long and Prosper."
232 True ['Cyrus the Great'] The Jewish community holds a deep appreciation for the Persian Emperor Cyrus the Great, who is considered a liberator in Jewish history. This is due to the decree he issued in 538 BCE, which allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple. This event is recorded in the biblical books of Ezra and Isaiah. Cyrus is revered in the Jewish tradition as a righteous gentile and a messianic figure, and his tomb is a popular pilgrimage site for some Jews in Iran.
233 True ['Prince Albert'] The man you are referring to is His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco. He is the sovereign ruler of Monaco, a Marquis of Baux (a title associated with the Princely House of Monaco), known for his involvement in various charities and organizations, and often described as a "man about town" due to his active social life and public appearances. Prince Albert II also has significant influence and pull within Monaco and beyond, given his position as the head of state.
234 True ['Aye-Aye'] The lemur described as having the face of a possum, the teeth of a rat, and the ears of a bat is the Aye-Aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis). This nocturnal primate is native to Madagascar and is known for its unique physical features and specialized feeding behaviors. Its elongated middle finger is adapted for extracting insects from tree bark, and its rodent-like teeth help it gnaw through the wood. The large, bat-like ears aid in detecting the calls of its insect prey.
235 False ['Downtrodden'] Paul Auster did not write "The New Colossus." This poem is actually by Emma Lazarus, and it was written in 1883 as a fundraiser for the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. The poem does indeed turn the Statue of Liberty into a symbol of hope for outcasts and oppressed people. Here is the full text of the poem:

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from terrifying seas,
Swallowing up mother earth and standing,
Foot on her head, with world-crushing weight on his shoulders.

But come, my friend,
'This new colossus
Whose wretched refuse your teeming shores have sent
Through the homogenous mists of the latest century:
Beware these, the spoiled remnants of the Old World,
Crude, unworthy castaways of European dust!

Take me, sister, give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!

So, the poem is a call to welcome the tired, poor, huddled masses, the wretched refuse, and the homeless, tempest-tost people to the United States.
236 True ['For Your Eyes Only'] The short story collection you're referring to is titled "For Your Eyes Only" and was published in 1960. The title "Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond" is not an official subtitle, but rather a description often used to summarize the content of this collection. These five short stories were not directly related to the films of the same name, but they did feature James Bond and contributed to his character development in the literary universe.
237 True ['Dawn Treader'] Lord Drinian is the captain of the Dawn Treader in "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," which is the sixth book in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia series.
238 False ['Cats Cradle'] The chapters "Ice-Nine" and "Tutored by Bokonon" are from Kurt Vonnegut's novel "Cat's Cradle." This book, published in 1963, is a satirical and absurdist work that explores themes of science, religion, and morality. In "Ice-Nine," Vonnegut introduces a fictional substance that can turn water into a solid at temperatures just above freezing, leading to catastrophic consequences. In "Tutored by Bokonon," the protagonist, a writer named Jonas, learns about the religion of Bokononism from the fictional island's resident prophet, Bokonon. This religion, with its unique beliefs and practices, serves as a commentary on human nature and the absurdity of organized religion.
239 False ['Coho'] The word you're looking for is "whiskey." The four-letter sequence inside it that resembles silver salmon is "salmon" if you imagine the "s" as the head and the "alm" as the body of the fish. However, this is a playful interpretation as there is no actual silver salmon inside the word.
240 False ['Calla'] The two-word description for colorful flowers that are a type of lily could be "Stargazer Lilies" or "Easter Lilies." Both of these lily varieties have vibrant and attractive blooms. Stargazer Lilies have rich pink petals with orange edges and a fragrant scent, while Easter Lilies have large, pure white flowers with a slight green tint at the base.
241 False ['Bubba Ho-Tep'] The dialogue you provided is from the movie "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure," which was released in 1979. In this sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure," Elvis Presley plays the character of Captain Mike Rogers, who leads a group of people on a quest to find the lost shipwreck of the original Poseidon. The quote you provided is from a scene where they discuss their plan to explore an ancient Egyptian tomb that they believe contains the mummy of a powerful pharaoh.
242 True ['Isle of Wight'] The English island where Queen Victoria had her vacation residence is known as "Isle of Wight." This picturesque island located in the English Channel has been a favored retreat for British monarchs since the time of King Henry VIII. Queen Victoria spent many of her holidays there between 1845 and 1901. Today, the Isle of Wight is an administrative county, and its largest town is Newport.
243 False ['Formaldehyde'] The uncapped oil wells in the USA can issue forth various harmful substances, including greenhouse gases like methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Regarding carcinogens, there is no direct link between uncapped oil wells and embalming agents. Embalming agents are typically used in the process of preserving deceased bodies for funeral services and contain various chemicals, some of which can be carcinogenic. However, the primary hazardous substances emitted from uncapped oil wells are not typically associated with embalming agents.
244 False ['Berkshires'] The Williamstown Theater Festival is located in the town of Williamstown, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Hills. Olympia Dukakis and Christopher Reeve were indeed regular actors at this renowned theater festival. Dukakis made her first appearance at Williamstown in 1962, and Reeve joined the festival in 1979. Both actors went on to have successful careers in film, television, and theater.
245 True ['Ceres'] The only dwarf planet that orbits the sun closer than Neptune is Pluto. However, it's important to note that the definition of a planet was changed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006, and Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Pluto's orbit crosses the orbit of Neptune, which is one of the reasons it was demoted from planet status. Other known dwarf planets that orbit closer to the sun than Neptune include Ceres in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper Belt Objects Haumea and Makemake.
246 False ['Arthur Ashe'] The quote "The night I met Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in the summer of 1975, I went to bed and slept soundly" is from the character Grace in the novel "Days of Grace" by John McGahern.
247 True ['Rhone', 'Rhône'] The Rhone River is the answer to this query. This European river originates near Lake Geneva, which is situated between Switzerland and France, and flows approximately 500 miles (800 kilometers) before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea near Marseilles, in southern France.
248 False ['todo el mundo'] The Spanish phrase for "everybody" that literally means "all the world" is "todos el mundo." However, it's important to note that the more common and idiomatic way to express "everybody" in Spanish is "todas/tosos las personas" (all the people) or simply "todos" (all). "Todos el mundo" is a more formal or poetic expression that can be used to emphasize the idea of including everyone in the entire world.
249 True ['John Singer Sargent'] The three-named painter whom Teddy Roosevelt reportedly praised for his official White House portrait is John Singer Sargent. However, it's essential to note that Roosevelt made this statement after seeing a preliminary version of the painting, not the final one. The completed portrait, titled "Theodore Roosevelt," is now housed at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.
250 True ['Pump and Dump', 'Pump Dump', 'Pumping and Dumping', 'Pumping Dumping', 'pump-and-dump'] The rhyming fraudulent investing scheme you're referring to is called a "pump and dump." In this scheme, individuals artificially inflate the price of a stock through false and misleading statements, hype, or insider trading. Once they've boosted the price, they sell their shares, leaving other investors with significant losses when the stock price eventually drops.
251 False ['Dalí', 'Dali'] The Spanish artist that Director Luis Buñuel recalled in his film "My Last Sigh" (Mi último suspiro) seducing women and placing fried eggs on their shoulders is a fictional character. Buñuel created this anecdote as an allegory for the artist's creative process and the role of chance in art. There is no historical evidence of a real Spanish artist engaging in such behavior.
252 True ['baptism'] The ritual that Jesus underwent when he was about 30 years old, as described in Luke 3:21-22, was his baptism in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. This event marked the beginning of Jesus' public ministry.
253 True ['factorial'] The exclamation mark (!) following a number is a mathematical notation called "factorial." It represents the product of all positive integers up to and including that number. So, 3! (read as "three factorial") is the product of 3, 2, and 1, which equals 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.
254 False ['Ullman'] The British comedian who portrayed Betty Friedan in the TV miniseries 'Mrs. America' is Sarah Lancashire. Although she is known for her humor in shows like "Last Tango in Halifax" and "Coronation Street," her role in "Mrs. America" is a more serious departure from her usual comedic roles.
255 True ['Niger'] The Songhai Empire existed in what is now western Niger and eastern Mali in West Africa. Its reign is estimated to have lasted from around 1375 to 1591, with its peak during the 15th and early 16th centuries. Mansa Musa, one of the most famous rulers of the Songhai Empire, reigned from around 1312 to 1337. However, the Songhai Empire officially ended in 1591 when it was conquered by the Moroccan army led by Al-Mansur Al-Dhari.
256 True ['scallop'] Coquilles St. Jacques is a French dish made with scallops cooked in a creamy white wine sauce, topped with breadcrumbs and browned under the broiler. The main ingredient in Coquilles St. Jacques is scallops. Other key ingredients include white wine, heavy cream, breadcrumbs, and butter. Some recipes may also include shallots, garlic, and parsley for added flavor.
257 True ['mitochondria', 'mitochondrion'] The term "Powerhouse of the Cell" to describe mitochondria was not used in a 1957 Scientific American article. However, this metaphorical name for mitochondria became popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s, around the time when their role in cellular respiration and energy production was fully understood. The misconception likely arises from the common association of mitochondria with energy production, which was established during this time.
258 True ['deadlocked'] The correct answer is "deadlocked." However, it's important to note that "deadlocked" is not a common 10-letter adjective used to describe a tie in sports. More commonly, sports writers might use the terms "stalemate" or "standoff" to describe a tie. But since you specifically asked for a 10-letter adjective, "deadlocked" is the closest fit.
259 True ['Quisling'] Vidkun Quisling is the Norwegian who sold out his country during World War II and became a synonym for traitor. He was the leader of the Norwegian fascist Nasjonal Samling (National Unity) party, and after the German invasion of Norway in 1940, he collaborated with the Nazis to establish a pro-German government in Norway. Quisling served as the Minister-President of Norway from October 1940 to May 1945. He is widely reviled in Norway for his collaborationist activities and is considered a national disgrace.
260 True ['Harder to Breathe'] I believe you are referring to Maroon 5's debut single titled "Harder to Breathe." However, the actual lyrics of the song do not include the exact phrase "Is there anyone out there?" It starts with the line "I'm not giving you a pen, I'm not giving you a pen to write your apology."
261 True ['Orange'] The Orange River

The Ernest Oppenheimer Bridge is a significant structure that connects South Africa and Namibia. It spans the Orange River, which is the longest river in South Africa and the second-longest river in the African continent. The bridge is named after Ernest Oppenheimer, a prominent South African businessman and the father of Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The bridge is an essential transportation link between the two countries, facilitating the movement of people and goods across the border.
262 False ['Charley Pride'] I apologize for any confusion, but Jimmy Allen's song "Down Home" does not mention any specific trailblazing black country singer who died in 2020. There have been several influential black country musicians throughout history, but none that I'm aware of who passed away in that year and were specifically mentioned in that song.
263 True ['Minoan'] The Phaistos Disc is a circular clay artifact covered in symbols, discovered during the excavation of a Minoan palace in Crete. The exact culture associated with its creation is a subject of ongoing debate among scholars. Most agree that it was produced during the Minoan civilization's late Bronze Age period (around 1600-1700 BC). However, the meaning and purpose of the disc's symbols remain a mystery, making it a fascinating enigma in archaeology.
264 True ['Foucault'] The French thinker who explored power dynamics in society through the lens of sexuality in a multi-volume work is Michel Foucault. His "History of Sexuality" is a three-volume study published between 1976 and 1984. In these books, Foucault examines how sexuality has been used as a tool of power and control throughout history, particularly in the context of Western society. He argues that sexuality is not a natural or private aspect of human life, but rather a social construct that has been shaped by various power structures, including religion, medicine, and the state.
265 True ['Walther'] Contrary to popular belief, Ian Fleming did not switch Bond's gun to a Walther PPK or PPS due to a fan letter referring to the Beretta as "unfeminine" for a lady. Instead, Fleming made the change for more practical reasons. He wanted a more authentic and less conspicuous gun for Bond, as the Walther models were favored by the German police and secret services at the time. The misconception likely arose due to the similarity in names between the Beretta and Walther manufacturers and the popular belief that Fleming was influenced by a fan letter.
266 True ['ooze'] Globigerina is a type of foraminifer, a group of single-celled or multi-celled organisms that form tests (shells) with calcite or aragonite. They are commonly found in marine environments, particularly in deep ocean sediments. The tests of Globigerina species are characterized by their size and shape, which are often used to study past climatic conditions.

The gooey mud or sediment containing dead Globigerina organisms is called chalk or calcareous ooze. This type of sediment is rich in calcium carbonate and is formed primarily by the accumulation of the tests of planktonic foraminifera, including Globigerina, as well as other calcareous organisms such as coccolithophores. Chalk deposits can be several meters thick and are important sources of fossil fuels and other resources.
267 True ['Brave New World'] The quote "What you need is a gramme of Soma. All the advantages of Christianity and Alcohol - none of their defects" is from Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel "Brave New World." In the story, Soma is a drug used by the society to keep its citizens happy and content, suppressing their negative emotions and pain.
268 True ['Murray'] The Murray-Darling Basin in Australia is the largest river system in the country, with a total length of approximately 1,500 miles (2,425 kilometers). The Murray and Darling rivers are the two longest rivers that flow within this basin. The Murray River is the larger of the two, with a length of around 1,553 miles (2,500 kilometers), while the Darling River is the second largest, with a length of about 1,470 miles (2,365 kilometers). Therefore, the answer to your question is that the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia includes the 1,500 mile-long rivers, the Murray River and the Darling River.
269 True ['ACL', 'anterior cruciate'] After undergoing knee surgery, the ligament that is commonly involved in a lengthy recovery process is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The healing time for an ACL reconstruction can take up to 12 months or more, depending on the individual's age, overall health, and the specifics of the surgical procedure. This extended recovery period is necessary to allow the new ligament graft to integrate fully into the knee joint and restore its stability.

However, you mentioned that the dissolving stitches should be gone in three weeks. This refers to the sutures used to close the incision made during the surgery. These stitches are typically absorbable and do not need to be removed, as they will dissolve on their own within three weeks.

It's important to note that the recovery timeline for the ligament itself is much longer than the time it takes for the stitches to dissolve. During this period, you may need to follow a strict rehabilitation program to ensure proper healing and regain full function of your knee. This may include physical therapy, exercises, and other interventions as recommended by your healthcare provider.
270 False ['Morris'] The 19th century Arts and Crafts Movement designer with a name that fits well in Hollywood and is known for creating wallpapers like "Rose" and "Jasmine" is named Marmion Warren Harleston. Despite his intriguing name, there isn't much information available about his life or background in the entertainment industry. However, he made significant contributions to the world of decorative arts, particularly in the realm of wallpaper design. His works, which often featured floral motifs, were highly regarded for their beauty and craftsmanship during the Arts and Crafts Movement.
271 True ['Addams Family Values'] The answer to the riddle is "Addams Family Values." In this 1993 movie sequel, Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to summer camp. The title of the film is a play on words, as "Addams Family Values" refers to the unique values and traditions of the Addams family, while also implying the idea of adding value or improvement through the experiences at summer camp.
272 True ['Done', 'Dun'] The homophones that are described by the words "finished" and "drab" are:

1. Finished: This homophone refers to the completion of a task or project, or the state of being completely done. For example, "I finished my homework before dinner," or "The painting was finished last week."

2. Drab: This homophone refers to something that is dull, uninteresting, or lacking in color or excitement. For example, "The drab gray sky made everything look gloomy," or "The drab uniforms of the soldiers blended into the background."

So, "finished" is the opposite of "unfinished," and "drab" is the opposite of "vibrant" or "colorful."
273 True ['Zworykin'] Vladimir Zworykin, a Russian-American inventor, filed a patent for the Iconoscope on October 7, 1923. The Iconoscope was the first television transmission tube that could both scan an image and amplify the resulting electrical signal. This invention was a significant step towards the development of practical television systems.
274 False ['Sharp Objects and Gone Girl', 'Sharp Objects Gone Girl'] I'm sorry for any confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The term 'Sharp Girl' is not a reference to a specific book or two books by the same author. If you could please provide more context or specify which books you are asking about, I would be happy to help.
275 True ['Bayreuth'] The Bayreuth Festival, founded by Richard Wagner himself in 1876, is the German music festival you're looking for. It is primarily known for its annual presentation of Wagner's operas, held in the city of Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany.
276 False ['Hoyle'] The name of the 18th century whist expert and author who is often invoked as a cards authority is Robert Abbot. He is known for his book "A Treatise on the Game of Whist," which was first published in 1742 and went through several editions. Abbot's work was influential in establishing the rules and etiquette of the game of whist, which was a popular card game in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.
277 True ['Brooklyn Decker'] The actress and model who married tennis player Andy Roddick in 2009 is Brooklyn Decker. She is an American model and actress, best known for her appearances in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and her roles in films such as "Just Go with It" and "What to Expect When You're Expecting." Roddick is a former world No. 1 tennis player.
278 False ['Paddock'] The answer to the riddle is "stable." A stable is a building where horses are kept and cared for, and it's where they are saddled before being taken out for racing or exercise.
279 True ['wasp'] The New Mexico state insect is indeed the tarantula hawk wasp. This wasp preys on tarantulas and is known for its powerful sting, which is considered one of the most painful in the insect world. The tarantula hawk paralyzes the tarantula with its sting and then lays its eggs on the tarantula. The tarantula hawk larvae feed on the living tarantula, using it as a source of food until they pupate and transform into adult wasps.
280 False ['Cronkite'] Peter Mansbridge was the longest-serving chief anchor or news anchor at CBC News in Canada. However, there is no direct equivalent to the position he held after a CBS news anchor stepped down in 1981. In 1981, Dan Rather was the anchor of the CBS Evening News in the United States, but Mansbridge did not begin his tenure as CBC's chief anchor until 1996. Mansbridge's role was significant in Canadian broadcasting, but it did not directly follow the departure of a CBS news anchor.
281 True ['Graham'] The 1949 article you're referring to is likely about Billy Graham's revival meetings. Graham's evangelistic crusades indeed drew large crowds, with more than 20,000 people reportedly attending some of his meetings in big tents. Graham's ministry began gaining significant attention in the late 1940s and continued to grow throughout the 1950s and beyond.
282 True ['Odenkirk'] Bob Odenkirk, known for his Emmy-winning role as Saul Goodman in "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul," is back in the AMC family with a new project titled "Lucky Hank." In this series, Odenkirk portrays Hank Devereaux, a disillusioned lawyer who leaves his practice to work as a high school literature teacher. The show is based on the novel "Teaching the Dog to Sit" by Craig Brown.
283 False ['lowkey'] The term you're looking for is likely "lit," which means something is exciting, fun, or impressive. So the phrase would be "lit when X is the vibe" or "when X is the vibe, it's lit." This is similar in meaning to "down-low and goated," which means something is secretly great or cool.
284 True ['Cloisters'] The novel Jenna Bush recommended that is as Gothic as you can get and is named for and set at a specific branch of the Met, is "The Cloisters Museum" by S.A. Chakraborty. However, it's important to note that this is a work of fiction and not an actual novel. The Cloisters is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, dedicated to the art and architecture of Europe from the Middle Ages through the end of the Renaissance. The title of the book may be a nod to this fact, but I couldn't find any evidence that it is actually set there.
285 True ['Punchbowl'] The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as the Punchbowl National Cemetery, is located in the Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu, Hawaii. This cemetery is a significant military cemetery where many soldiers who died in the Pacific Theater of World War II, as well as other conflicts, are buried. The crater's unique location and beautiful surroundings make it a peaceful and fitting place for honoring and remembering the sacrifices of these brave individuals.
286 False ['Healall'] I'm glad you asked about Robert Frost's poem "Design," but I must clarify that there is no mention of a flower known for its curative powers in this particular poem. The poem explores themes of free will, fate, and the natural world. Its opening lines describe a traveler who comes upon two paths in the woods and contemplates which one to take. The rest of the poem reflects on the choices we make and the consequences that follow.
287 True ['Gastroenteritis'] The Norovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. While "gastroenteritis" is a 13-letter word, you asked for a 15-letter term, so let me provide an alternative: "gastrointestinal inflammation." However, it's important to note that this phrase is not commonly used in everyday language or medical contexts to describe the condition caused by Norovirus or other similar viruses.
288 False ['The Good The Bad and The Ugly American', 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly American'] The correct answer is "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." In this iconic Western film, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach compete for a fortune in gold during the American Civil War. Meanwhile, Marlon Brando portrays the unsympathetic character of Colonel Mortimer, an unscrupulous Union officer who gives Americans a bad name by betraying his own men and collaborating with the Italians. The movie was released in 1966, both before and after Brando's controversial portrayal in "The Godfather" (1972).
289 True ['Shinto'] The Torii gates you are referring to are indeed a common feature found at the entrances of Shinto shrines in Japan. Torii gates mark the boundary or threshold between the secular world and the sacred space within the shrine. Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, often described as animistic or polytheistic, which centers around the belief in the kami or spirits that inhabit the natural world. The Way of the Gods, or Shinto, is the traditional religion of the Japanese people, and the Torii gates serve as a physical manifestation of the spiritual boundary between the mundane world and the sacred realm of the kami.
290 True ['Reposado'] The type of tequila that takes a siesta, or a long rest, in its barrel for several months, developing a golden hue, is called Añejo tequila. This type of tequila undergoes a longer aging process than other types, such as Blanco (silver) or Reposado, resulting in a richer, more complex flavor and the golden color.
291 True ['Stockholm'] August Strindberg, a renowned Swedish playwright and author, passed away in the capital city of Stockholm, Sweden, in 1912. His life and works were indeed heavy on drama, both in his personal life and in his literary contributions.
292 True ['Hagar'] Sarah gave her handmaid Hagar to Abraham as a concubine when she believed she was unable to have children. Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, who is considered the firstborn son of Abraham in the Islamic and Hebrew traditions. In the Jewish and Christian traditions, Ishmael is not considered a son of Sarah but rather of Abraham and Hagar.
293 True ['Gluon'] The particles that bind quarks inside protons and neutrons are called "gluons." Contrary to their name suggesting a sticky nature for the particles that bind quarks, it is actually the strong force carried by gluons that holds quarks together in a proton or neutron. This misconception might arise due to the term "sticky" being commonly used to describe the strong force, but in reality, it is the gluons that are the carriers of this force.
294 True ['Tessera', 'Tessellation', 'tessellated'] The distinctive flooring pattern of teeny squares or tiles, often used in mosaics, is called a mosaic pavement or tessellated pavement. Tessellation refers to the arrangement of shapes without gaps or overlaps, which is a common technique used in creating mosaic patterns.
295 True ['My So-Called Life', 'My So Called Life'] My Apologies for any confusion, you're absolutely correct in your question. Claire Danes starred as Angela Chase in the American television series "My So-Called Life." This show, which aired from 1994 to 1995, explored the trials and tribulations of adolescence with a raw and honest portrayal. It was praised for its depth and complexity, and Danes' performance as Angela was particularly noteworthy.
296 False ['coati'] The animals you are referring to are ring-tailed cats or ringtails. Ringtails are not actually raccoons, but they are related to the raccoon family (Procyonidae). Ringtails are native to the southwestern United States, including Arizona and New Mexico, as well as Mexico and Central America. They are named for the distinctive black rings on their long, bushy tails.
297 True ['Irene Cara'] I'm here to provide information, not to express sadness. However, I can tell you that the artist who didn't live to see her song "Flashdance...What a Feeling" make it into the National Recording Registry was Irene Cara. She passed away in November 2013, and the song was added to the registry in 2014.
298 True ['JuJu', 'joujou', 'gris'] In Voodoo shops, you can buy mojo or gris-gris bags. These are small, decorative pouches filled with a variety of ingredients believed to bring protection, luck, love, or other desirable outcomes. The specific ingredients used can vary widely depending on the intended purpose and the particular traditions or beliefs of the practitioner. Some common ingredients might include herbs, roots, stones, bones, hair, or even personal items like photographs or clothing. The bags themselves are often decorated with symbols or charms thought to enhance their power.
299 False ['Shelley'] The answer to this riddle is Lord Byron. He was a British poet known for his intense romanticism and his famous quote, "I have nothing to offer but my verse." The phrase "Unbound effort" likely refers to his prolific and groundbreaking poetic achievements, while "drowning, his sorrows" might allude to his notorious lifestyle, which included heavy drinking and debauchery. Byron is best known for his romantic poetry, including "She Walks in Beauty" and "Don Juan."
300 True ['Burundi'] The country you're referring to is most likely Burundi. Historically, the Tutsi ethnic group held political power in Burundi, while the larger Hutu population made up the majority of the population. This power dynamic has led to significant ethnic tensions and conflict in the country.
301 True ['Carillon'] The term you're looking for is "carillon." A carillon is a set of at least 23 bells, suspended in a tower or a belfry, which are played by striking with hammers from a keyboard. The carillonist sits at a console and plays the bells, producing melodic tunes or peals. The number of bells in a carillon can range from 23 to as many as 78 or more.
302 True ['Leslie Groves'] General Leslie Groves is the hard-driving US Army officer who is described as the "Indispensable Man" of the Manhattan Project. He oversaw the project from its inception in 1942 until the successful testing of the atomic bomb in July 1945, and the subsequent use of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Groves' strong leadership and management skills were instrumental in bringing together the diverse team of scientists and engineers who made the development of the atomic bomb a reality.
303 True ['Chicago'] Chicago, Illinois, United States

A labor rally and subsequent riot took place in Chicago's Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886. The event began as a peaceful demonstration for workers' rights, but it escalated into violence when someone threw a bomb into the crowd of police officers, killing several officers and civilians. The aftermath led to the infamous "Chicago Seven" trial, where several labor leaders were falsely accused and convicted of the bombing. The incident is now known as the Haymarket Riot or the Haymarket Massacre.
304 True ['Typee'] Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is Herman Melville's first novel, despite its subtitle suggesting it is a peek into Polynesian life rather than a work of fiction. Melville drew heavily from his experiences as a sailor in the South Pacific for this novel, which was published in 1846. It is considered an early example of travel literature and ethnography, as well as an influential work in the development of the American novel.
305 True ['griot'] In the novel "Night of the Kings" by Joseph Oneko, the prisoner who tells stories to stay alive is known as "Roman-Texas," a character based on the figure of the same name from West African folklore. Roman-Texas is a type of storyteller or "griot" who holds a significant role in the traditional societies of the region. These griots are often responsible for preserving and passing down the oral histories, myths, and cultural traditions of their communities. In the novel, Roman-Texas uses his storytelling abilities to navigate the dangerous world of the prison and survive the night of the kings, a ritual during which the lives of certain prisoners are decided.
306 True ['Eat, Pray, Love', 'Eat Pray Love'] The title by Elizabeth Gilbert that spent 57 weeks as a No. 1 on the New York Times paperback nonfiction bestseller list is "Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia." This memoir was first published in 2006 and has since become a cultural phenomenon. The book chronicles Gilbert's journey of self-discovery after a difficult divorce, as she travels to Italy to enjoy life, India to find spirituality, and Indonesia to fall in love.
307 False ['Marcel'] The answer to the riddle is "Bob" for the first name and "wave" for the hairstyling term. The name "Bob" was once common in France but its popularity declined significantly after the 1920s. The hairstyle "wave" was popularized in the 1920s and 1930s, but the name "Bob" is not related to this hairstyle.
308 True ['Livy'] The ancient scholar who wrote a comprehensive history of Rome that includes accounts of the battles against Hannibal is Titus Livius, better known as Livy. However, it's important to clarify that Livy's "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" (From the Founding of the City) consists of only 142 books in the modern edition, but it was likely originally written as 120 books. Livy's work covers the history of Rome from its legendary founding to the point where he lived, around 27 BC.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] The phrase "set a course for" is not directly derived from a specific 1855 book title. However, the book "Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville, published in 1851, contains the expression "mood and direction setting" in relation to whales choosing their course through the water. The more common modern phrase "set a course for" likely comes from nautical terminology.
310 True ['Pangaea'] The continents were not combined into a single landmass named "Pangaea" because the term "Pangaea" specifically means "all earth" in Ancient Greek. Instead, the supercontinent that existed during the Late Paleozoic Era, around 300 million years ago, was named Pangaea based on its geological features and the meaning of the Greek word "pan" (all) and "gaia" (earth). So, Pangaea was not named "All Earth" in the literal sense, but rather it was a term coined by scientists to describe the large landmass that encompassed most of the Earth's land area during that time.
311 True ['Black Sabbath'] The song "War Pigs" or "War of the Roses" was not originally written or performed by a British heavy metal band. It was actually composed by the American band Black Sabbath. The song's lyrics do contain references to war and the devil, but it's important to note that the band never explicitly stated that war was the real Satanism. The song's title was later changed to "Iron Man" for their debut album to avoid potential controversy.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] The answer to your riddle is the Cadillac Ranch, located in Amarillo, Texas. This famous roadside attraction features a collection of old Cadillacs, half-buried nose-first in the ground. Visitors are welcome to come and spray paint the cars, making it a popular stop for travelers on Route 66.
313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] Tycho Brahe, the renowned 16th century Danish astronomer, is known for his distinctive golden prosthetic nose. However, recent archaeological findings suggest that the nose might not have been made of gold after all. Instead, it is believed to have been made of brass or another metal. This discovery challenges the long-held belief about Tycho Brahe's golden nose.
314 False ['Peccadillo'] The answer to this riddle is "llagas." This word comes from the Spanish language and means "wounds" or "small injuries." However, in a figurative sense, it is also used to refer to minor faults or quirks. The "ll" sound in this word is a double "l" ligature, which is a common feature in the Spanish language.
315 True ['Xerxes'] Xerxes I

The Battle of Salamis, which took place on September 20, 480 BC, was a pivotal naval engagement during the Second Persian Invasion of Greece. The Greek forces, led by Themistocles, took on the much larger Persian navy, commanded by Xerxes I, the son of Darius I. The Greeks were able to achieve a decisive victory, which significantly weakened the Persian invasion and ultimately led to their eventual withdrawal from Greece.
316 False ['Air Force Quit'] The before and after phrase you are looking for is: "A nation's military planes getting iced over and requiring key presses on a Mac or PC to defrost and exit?" to "A nation's military planes needing to be defrosted before takeoff, and pressing a specific key combination on a Mac or PC to help with the defrosting process."

This phrase describes how military planes can experience icing over in cold weather, which can require ground crew or pilots to take certain actions to defrost the planes before takeoff. In the modern context, some military planes and even some civilian aircraft use heated wings and windshields to prevent icing, but in older planes or in extreme conditions, manual defrosting may still be necessary.

In the context of a computer, the phrase refers to a situation where the graphical user interface (GUI) of the operating system (OS) on a Mac or PC freezes up, making it impossible to use the computer normally. In this case, pressing a specific key combination can help to force the OS to exit the frozen state and return to normal operation.

Therefore, the before and after phrase describes how military planes require manual defrosting in cold weather, and how pressing a key combination on a Mac or PC can help to defrost and exit a frozen OS.
317 True ['Stevens'] Ted Stevens: In 2000, Anchorage International Airport was renamed Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in honor of Ted Stevens, who was then the longest-serving Senate Republican and the longest-serving Alaska Senator. Stevens had played a significant role in securing federal funding for the airport's expansion projects.
318 False ['The Way Way Back'] The We're the Millers (2013) film does not directly refer to a place to sit in a station wagon called a "Buick Estate" in its title. However, the movie does involve a character named "David Clark" who drives a 1973 Buick Century station wagon in the film. The title of the movie is "We're the Millers."
319 True ['fenugreek'] The national dish of Iran, Ghormeh Sabzi, does not contain any leaves with European nationality in their names. The key ingredients of Ghormeh Sabzi are various herbs and leaves such as parsley, cilantro, spinach, and fenugreek. Some recipes may also include dried limes and kidney beans. European ingredients do not play a significant role in this traditional Iranian stew.
320 True ['Moldova'] Moldova is the Danube nation south of Ukraine that gained its independence from Russia in 1991. The country underwent a name modification, changing from the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic to the Republic of Moldova. Moldova joined the United Nations on March 2, 1992.
321 True ['Byrd'] The American explorer who returned to Antarctica in the 1930s and had to be rescued in 1934, suffering from frostbite, was Richard E. Byrd. Byrd was a prominent Antarctic explorer who had previously led the first solo flight over the South Pole in 1929. In 1933-1935, he led the International Antarctic Expedition, during which he made extensive scientific studies and set up several research stations. However, during his return journey in 1934, his plane crashed due to engine failure, leaving him and his crew stranded in the ice. They were eventually rescued after a heroic effort by the U.S. Navy. Byrd's frostbite injuries were severe, and he lost several toes on both feet. Despite this setback, he continued his explorations and made further significant contributions to Antarctic research.
322 True ['Broca'] Broca's Area: This specific region in the left frontal lobe of the human brain was named after Paul Broca, a 19th-century French anthropologist and pathologist. Broca's Area is primarily associated with language production, specifically the articulation and formulation of speech. Damage to this area can result in expressive aphasia, a condition characterized by difficulty in producing coherent speech.
323 True ['Kim Philby'] Harry Lime, the character in Graham Greene's novel "The Third Man" and the film of the same name, is not directly based on any known British spy or Soviet double agent. However, there are theories suggesting that elements of the character may have been inspired by various real-life figures. One of the most popular theories is that Lime was influenced by the real-life British double agent Kim Philby.

Kim Philby was a high-ranking British intelligence officer who was revealed to be a Soviet spy in 1963. He had fled to the Soviet Union in 1961, but before that, he had lived in Vienna, Austria, where "The Third Man" is set. The similarities between Lime and Philby include their charisma, intelligence, and ability to deceive people. Additionally, Lime's plan to cause a black market scandal in Vienna may have been inspired by Philby's involvement in a real-life scandal involving the theft of British secrets.

However, it's important to note that Graham Greene himself denied that Lime was based on Philby. Greene stated that Lime was a fictional character and that he had no knowledge of Philby's activities at the time he wrote the novel. Despite this, the theory persists due to the striking similarities between the two men.
324 True ['greenback'] The political party you're referring to is known as the "Greenbacks" or the "Greenback Party." This name came from the green-colored paper currency they advocated for and sought to increase in circulation during the 1860s and 1870s. This party emerged during the aftermath of the American Civil War, as a response to the financial challenges faced by the country during that time. They believed that increasing the supply of paper money would help stimulate the economy and reduce the burden of debt on farmers and other common people.
325 False ['Nutmegger'] The term you might be looking for is "Maineans." Maine is a state in New England, and there is no spice specifically associated with people from Maine. The word "Connecticutes" is not a standard term for people from Connecticut, and it does not mention a spice either.
326 False ['phlox'] The answer to your riddle is Carnations. Carnations come in various colors, including pink, and their names end with the letter 'x.' This phrase is a common expression used to describe a gift of flowers, often given to express love or admiration.
327 True ['Pictures at an Exhibition'] The work you're referring to is "Pictures at an Exhibition," a musical composition by Modest Mussorgsky. Each of its ten movements represents a specific artwork created by Mussorgsky's late friend, Viktor Hartmann. The pieces were inspired by Hartmann's memorial exhibition in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1872. The titles of the movements correspond to the names of the artworks they represent. Some of the most famous movements include "Promenade," which acts as a connecting theme between the other pieces, and "The Great Gate of Kiev," which is often considered the most iconic movement.
328 False ['Dewey'] Earl Warren was never a vice presidential running mate for any major political party in the United States. He served as the Governor of California from 1943 to 1953 before being appointed as the Chief Justice of the United States in 1953.
329 True ['phrenology'] Franz Joseph Gall is best known for developing the theory of phrenology. Phrenology is the belief that the shape and size of specific areas of the skull are indicative of the development and strength of particular mental faculties or abilities. This pseudoscientific theory was widely discredited in the late 19th century as scientific evidence failed to support its claims. Today, it is generally regarded as a historical curiosity rather than a valid scientific theory.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Milan Kundera's second novel, "Life is Elsewhere," was not allowed to be published in Czechoslovakia during the communist regime when he was living there. The novel was first published in West Germany in 1973, and it was not until after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 that it was allowed to be published in Czechoslovakia. The communist regime in Czechoslovakia censored Kundera's work due to its critical portrayal of the regime and its exploration of themes such as individual freedom and the human condition.
331 False ['Tulum'] Both the Itza Hotel Akumal and the Mayan Monkey Hostel are trendy places to stay in the Riviera Maya, but they cater to different types of travelers.

The Itza Hotel Akumal is a mid-range hotel located in Akumal, a beautiful beach town known for its clear waters and sea turtles. This hotel is trendy due to its excellent location, comfortable rooms, and amenities such as a swimming pool and a restaurant. It's a popular choice for travelers who want a more relaxed and upscale hostel experience.

The Mayan Monkey Hostel, on the other hand, is a budget-friendly option located in Playa del Carmen. This hostel is trendy among backpackers and budget travelers due to its lively atmosphere, affordable prices, and central location. It offers dormitory-style rooms, as well as private rooms, and has a rooftop terrace with great views of the town.

Both hostels have their unique charm and are popular among travelers, so it ultimately depends on your personal preferences and budget. If you're looking for a more upscale and relaxed experience, the Itza Hotel Akumal might be the better choice. If you're on a budget and want to meet other travelers, the Mayan Monkey Hostel is a great option.
332 True ['Stefan Urquelle'] In season 5 of "Family Matters," Jaleel White's character, Steve Urkel, transforms into a suave and sophisticated alter ego named Stefan Urquelle. He does this by taking an elixir that was accidentally given to him by his neighbor, Freddy Hecler, who was trying to woo Laura Winslow. This transformation marks a significant change in the character's appearance and demeanor, making him more confident and attractive. However, Stefan's stay with the Winslow family is short-lived as his true identity is eventually revealed.
333 True ['Massachusetts'] Charles Sumner was a United States Senator from Massachusetts. The incident you're referring to is known as the "Caning of Sumner," which took place on May 22, 1856, in the United States Senate chamber. Sumner was nearly beaten to death by South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler in retaliation for Sumner's harsh criticism of Butler and his brother, South Carolina Senator Preston Brooks, in a speech on the Senate floor.
334 True ['Proulx'] The phrase "The summer range lay above the tree line on the forest service land on Brokeback Mountain" is a description from the novel "Brokeback Mountain" by Annie Proulx. She wrote the short story version in 1997, and it was later expanded into a novel in 1999.
335 True ['Winnebago'] I'd be happy to help you plan your RV trip to a beautiful American lake where you can catch northern pike and largemouth bass on Wisconsin's largest island. The lake I would recommend is Lake Winnebago, which is the largest lake in Wisconsin.

Lake Winnebago is located in eastern Wisconsin and is the largest lake in the state by surface area. It covers over 137,700 acres and has over 130 miles of shoreline. The lake is known for its excellent fishing opportunities, particularly for northern pike and largemouth bass.

The largest island on Lake Winnebago is Waupaca Island, which is a popular destination for campers and fishermen. The island has several campgrounds, including Waupaca Island Campground and Shady Hollow Campground, where you can park your RV and enjoy the beautiful lake views.

Northern pike and largemouth bass are abundant in Lake Winnebago, and you can catch them using various techniques such as trolling, jigging, and live bait fishing. The best time to fish for northern pike is during the spring and fall, while largemouth bass are most active during the summer months.

So, pack your RV, grab your fishing gear, and head to Lake Winnebago for an unforgettable fishing adventure on Wisconsin's largest island!
336 False ['Brancusi'] I'm unable to provide an exact answer to your question as there is no record of a Romanian artist carving multiple versions of "The Kiss" from stone blocks between 1908 and present day, to the best of my knowledge. The most famous depiction of "The Kiss" is Gustav Klimt's painting from 1907-1908. If you could please provide more context or details about the artist or specific sculptures you're referring to, I would be happy to help with further research.
337 True ['Boyhood'] Lorelei Linklater is the daughter of the American independent filmmaker Richard Linklater. She gained widespread attention for her role as Bodee, the daughter of Patricia Arquette's character, in the critically acclaimed film "Boyhood" (2014). The unique aspect of this project is that it was filmed over a period of 12 years, from 2002 to 2013. During this time, Lorelei grew from a 9-year-old girl to a 21-year-old woman. The film captures her transformation and development throughout the years, making it a remarkable achievement in cinema.
338 True ['Crossing the Bar'] The poem you're referring to is "Crossing the Bar" by Alfred Lord Tennyson. It's not an idiom for dying itself, but the last stanza of the poem has become an expression used when someone is preparing to embark on a journey, especially one that is likely to be their last. The phrase "to cross the bar" means to depart this life. Here's the last stanza of the poem:

"Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the sea,
But, sail on, sail on,
O Sunset! O Sea!

O rest ye Merchants, all! rest ye,
Every one that goes by sea,
Spare a thought for me;
And whatever you can do,
Though the wind may come to me,
Wreck me, cast me adrift,
Desolate, or make me lean,
As the sea and the winds may lean."
339 True ['Bhutan'] The correct answer is Bhutan. Paro International Airport is the only airport in Bhutan, and it is known for its challenging approach due to its location between steep mountains. Landing here is typically done visually in daylight conditions.
340 False ['Frankfurter'] The third Vienna-born man who was appointed as a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, after Louis Brandeis, was Hans J. Morgenthau. However, Morgenthau did not serve on the Supreme Court but rather on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Louis Brandeis was born on November 13, 1856, in Lubavitch, then part of the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine), and emigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child. He was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1916.

Hans J. Morgenthau was born on November 17, 1904, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now in Austria), and came to the United States in 1937 to escape the Nazi regime. He was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1953.

Therefore, a dual biography covering Louis Brandeis and Hans J. Morgenthau would highlight their shared Viennese heritage, their journeys to the United States, and their distinguished legal careers.
341 True ['atom'] In the early 1900s, the "Plum Pudding" model referred to the then-prevailing understanding of the internal structure of an atom, which was proposed by J.J. Thomson based on his discovery of the electron. According to this model, the positive charge of an atom was assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout a small, dense sphere, while the negatively charged electrons were embedded in this sphere like raisins in a plum pudding.

However, the Plum Pudding model was eventually replaced by the Rutherford-Bohr model, also known as the planetary model, which emerged in the late 1910s. In this model, the positive charge of the atom was concentrated in a small, dense nucleus at its center, while the electrons orbited the nucleus in distinct shells or energy levels. This model provided a more accurate explanation of the scattering of alpha particles in gold foil experiments conducted by Rutherford and his colleagues.
342 True ['Nikkei'] The equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Japan is called the Nikkei 225. It is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and is composed of 225 publicly traded companies in Japan that are representative of the broad economy. The index is price-weighted, meaning that companies with higher stock prices have a greater influence on the index's value.
343 False ['Aeschylus'] The ancient playwright whose work is rehearsed in Jacques Rivette's film "Out 1" (also known as "Out 1: Noli Me Tangere") is Sophocles. The specific play they rehearse is "Seven Against Thebes." This subplot in the film adds an interesting layer to the overall narrative, as the actors' intense rehearsals and preparations for the play intertwine with their own complex relationships and personal dramas.
344 True ['connoisseur'] The word you're looking for is "connoisseur." It comes from the French word "connaître," which means "to know." A connoisseur is someone who has extensive knowledge and appreciation for the arts, particularly in areas like fine wine, painting, or music.
345 False ['Mumbai'] No, Rudyard Kipling was born in a house called "The Elms" in Moulton Road, in the civil parish of Moulton, just outside the city of Birmingham, England. The location is now a suburb and there is no art school at the site. Kipling's birthplace is not in a huge metropolis, but in a relatively small town setting.
346 True ['The Little Foxes'] The play you're referring to is "The Little Foxes" by Lillian Hellman. In this drama, set in the American South during the late 1800s, the wealthy and ruthless Hubbard family conspires to make their fortunes through various underhanded schemes and manipulations. The play explores themes of greed, ambition, and the corrupting influence of wealth on human relationships.
347 False ['Histrionic'] Title: "FDR's 'Unexpected' Ability and the Dramatic in Politics"

Date: 1932

The 1932 article discusses Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) political career and his unique ability to connect with people, which the author refers to as his "unexpected" ability. The article highlights how FDR's charisma and dramatic flair have played a significant role in his political success.

The author begins by acknowledging that FDR's political rise was not anticipated by many, as he was not considered a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York. However, FDR's unexpected ability to captivate audiences and inspire loyalty proved to be a game-changer.

The article then delves into FDR's use of the dramatic in politics. The author notes that FDR's speeches were not just informative but also emotionally engaging. He would often use anecdotes, stories, and metaphors to illustrate his points and connect with his audience on a deeper level.

The author argues that the dramatic is not without value in politics. In fact, it can be an effective tool for persuasion and mobilization. FDR's ability to use the dramatic in his speeches helped him to rally support during the Great Depression and ultimately led to his election as President of the United States.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of authenticity and connection in politics. FDR's unexpected ability to connect with people on a personal level, combined with his use of the dramatic, made him a formidable political figure. The author suggests that other politicians could learn from FDR's example and use similar techniques to engage with their constituents and build lasting relationships.
348 True ['Kafka'] The author you're referring to is most likely Franz Kafka. He was born on July 3, 1883, so his Bar Mitzvah would have been celebrated on June 13, 1896, according to the Hebrew calendar. Known for his distinctive and often unsettling works, such as "Metamorphosis," "The Trial," and "The Castle," Kafka's literary contributions have left a lasting impact on the world of literature.
349 False ['Maxwell'] The character who uses a "Silver Hammer" to take out various people, including a quizzical Joan, an annoyed school teacher, and even the judge at his trial, is not from any well-known literary or cinematic work. The phrase "Silver Hammer" is derived from the Beatles song of the same name, but the song's lyrics do not provide any context about the identity or motives of the person wielding the silver hammer. Therefore, it is an incorrect assumption that this character exists in any literary or cinematic work.
350 True ['Morgan'] The pirate or buccaneer you're referring to is most likely Henry Morgan. He was a Welsh privateer and pirate who became a respected military and political figure in the British colonies of the Caribbean. Morgan was appointed as the Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica in 1674 by the English monarchy. He played a significant role in the conquest of Port Royal, Jamaica, and later Panama City, Panama. So, raise your glass of branded rum in honor of the legendary pirate-turned-deputy-governor, Henry Morgan. Cheers!
351 False ['Lincoln'] I apologize for the confusion, but there is no significant historical figure related to currency who died on April 15th. April 15th is known for being Tax Day in the United States, but it does not have any particular connection to currency or monetary history. If you have any other questions or inquiries, please feel free to ask.
352 True ['Maurier'] The scary story "The Birds" was originally a short story by Daphne du Maurier, published in 1952. However, it was Alfred Hitchcock who turned it into a big-screen thriller in 1963. Hitchcock's adaptation of the story is considered a classic in the genre of psychological horror films.
353 False ['Haydn'] The melody for the German national anthem, "Deutschlandlied" (Song of Germany), was composed by Friedrich Silcher in 1841. However, the lyrics were written by two poets, Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr von Stackelberg and August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, in 1841 as well. The myth that the melody was composed for the 1797 birthday of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II by an Austrian composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is a popular legend but lacks factual basis.
354 True ['Endorphins'] The hormones released during a hug that make us feel good are called endorphins. Endorphins are the body's natural painkillers and mood elevators. They are not named after any narcotic substance, but the word "endorphin" comes from the combination of two words: "endogenous" (meaning produced within the body) and "morphine" (a well-known opiate painkiller). However, endorphins do have a similar effect to opiates in terms of pain relief and mood enhancement.
355 True ['Polley'] I'm glad you asked about Sarah Polley. She is a Canadian actress, but she also has an impressive background in writing and directing. One of her notable works is the film "Women Talking," which she wrote and directed. This film, based on a Miriam Toews novel, premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival. Polley's multifaceted career in acting, writing, and directing is a testament to her versatility and talent in the Canadian arts scene.
356 False ['occlusion'] Yes, that's correct. In medicine, a blood vessel obstruction refers to a condition where there is a complete or partial blockage of blood flow in an artery or a vein. This can be caused by various conditions such as atherosclerosis, blood clots, or emboli. The blockage can lead to various health issues, depending on the location and extent of the obstruction. For instance, a blocked artery in the heart can cause a heart attack, while a blocked artery in the brain can lead to a stroke.
