The "revolutionary road" of the title refers to the ideals of the American Revolution, such as freedom, independence, and self-determination, which the Wheelers feel have been stifled by the conformity and materialism of post-war American society.

189 True ['101'] Legend has it that Carl Gauss, faced with the task of adding up the first 100 positive integers, quickly realized that he could pair the numbers in a certain way to make the calculation easier. He noticed that the numbers could be paired as follows: (1, 100), (2, 99), (3, 98), ..., (50, 51). Each pair adds up to the same total, which is:

1 + 100 = 101
2 + 99 = 101
3 + 98 = 101
...
50 + 51 = 101

So, each of the 50 pairs totals 101. To find the sum of the first 100 positive integers, you can simply multiply this total by the number of pairs:

Sum = 101 * 50 = 5050

Thus, the sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.

265 True ['Walther'] In the James Bond novels, the author Ian Fleming initially equipped Bond with a Beretta .25 ACP pistol. However, after receiving a letter from a firearms expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticizing the choice and suggesting a Walther PPK instead, Fleming decided to change Bond's gun. Boothroyd described the Beretta as "a lady's gun" and recommended the Walther PPK 7.65mm as a more suitable firearm for a professional agent like Bond. This change was reflected in the novel "Dr. No" and has remained Bond's signature weapon in the series ever since.

It's important to note that the Walther PPK is a German-designed pistol, not a British one. The confusion might arise from the fact that Bond is a British agent, but his signature firearm is not of British origin.

However, the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery is known for having a longer recovery period, often up to a year or more, before an individual can return to full activities. This is because the ACL is a major stabilizer of the knee and its reconstruction involves significant surgical intervention and a lengthy rehabilitation process.

As for the dissolving stitches, also known as absorbable sutures, they typically do dissolve within a few weeks after surgery. The exact time can depend on the type of suture material used, but three weeks is a common time frame.

299 False ['Shelley'] The poet you're referring to is Lord Byron, a prominent figure in the Romantic movement. His poem "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" is an unbound effort, as it is a lengthy narrative poem written in Spenserian stanzas. The poem's protagonist, Childe Harold, is a world-weary traveler who drowns his sorrows in drink and contemplation. Lord Byron himself was known for his unconventional and scandalous lifestyle, which often mirrored the romantic and melancholic themes in his poetry.
300 True ['Burundi'] Burundi

Burundi is a country in East Africa where the majority of the population is Hutu, but the Tutsi minority has historically held power. This has led to ethnic tensions and conflicts in the past.

His leadership was crucial in the development and deployment of the atomic bomb.

303 True ['Chicago'] Chicago

In May 1886, a labor demonstration in Chicago's Haymarket Square turned into a violent confrontation between police and protesters. The event, known as the Haymarket Riot or Haymarket Affair, began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour workday. However, when police attempted to disperse the crowd, a bomb was thrown, leading to the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians.

The Haymarket Riot had significant consequences, including the arrest and execution of several anarchist leaders who were accused of inciting violence, despite a lack of evidence linking them directly to the bombing. The event also led to increased public fear of anarchism and labor activism, as well as a backlash against the growing labor movement in the United States.
304 True ['Typee'] Herman Melville's first novel, which offers a glimpse into Polynesian life, is titled "Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life."

Marcel is a boy's first name that also refers to a hairstyling term. The Marcel wave is a styling technique that creates a wavy hairstyle. However, the name Marcel has not been a popular choice in France since the 1920s.
308 True ['Livy'] Titus Livius, commonly known as Livy, was the ancient scholar who wrote "Ab Urbe Condita Libri," a monumental history of Rome from its founding to Augustus' reign. This work, originally consisting of 142 volumes, includes detailed accounts of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal led the Carthaginian forces against Rome. Unfortunately, only 35 volumes have survived to the present day.
309 False ['Westward Ho'] Two Years Before the Mast

The phrase "two years before the mast" is often used to mean "let's head in a certain direction" or "let's get to work." It comes from the title of Richard Henry Dana Jr.'s 1855 book, "Two Years Before the Mast," which chronicles his experiences as a young man sailing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as a common sailor. The phrase "before the mast" refers to the area of a ship where the crew lived and worked, as opposed to the officers' quarters located aft (toward the back) of the ship.
310 False ['Pangaea'] Pangea

Pangea is the name given to the supercontinent that existed around 300 million years ago, which combined all of the continents we know today.

311 True ['Black Sabbath'] Black Sabbath

The song "War Pigs" by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath was intended to convey the message that war is the real Satanism. The song, which was released in 1970, is a critique of the Vietnam War and the military-industrial complex. The lyrics describe the horrors of war and the corrupt leaders who profit from it, and suggest that these leaders are the true "war pigs" who are responsible for the suffering and destruction caused by war. The song's title and lyrics also make reference to the occult and Satanism, which were common themes in Black Sabbath's music, but the band has stated that the song is not meant to be taken literally as a celebration of Satanism, but rather as a metaphor for the evils of war.
312 True ['Cadillac Ranch'] The famous Texas attraction you're referring to is the Cadillac Ranch, located in Amarillo, Texas. It's a unique public art installation where ten Cadillac cars are half-buried, nose-down in a field, with their tail fins sticking up in the air.

313 True ['Tycho Brahe'] Tycho Brahe, a renowned Danish astronomer from the 16th century, was recently exhumed, and it was discovered that his prosthetic nose was likely made of brass rather than gold. Brahe lost part of his nose in a duel and wore a prosthetic nose for the rest of his life. His eccentric personality, along with his significant contributions to the field of astronomy, have made him a fascinating historical figure.
314 False ['Peccadillo'] The word you're looking for is "flaw," which is derived from the Old French word "flau," meaning a gust of wind or a blast of air. However, it's interesting to note that "flaw" can also be connected to the Spanish word "falla," which means a fault or error. "Falla" is derived from the Latin word "fallere," meaning to deceive or trick. The diminutive form of "falla" is "fallita," which could be seen as a minor fault or quirk.

While "flaw" does not directly come from the Spanish word "falla," it shares a similar meaning and etymological root. The "ll" in "flaw" does not directly correspond to the "ll" in "fallita," but the connection between the words is still worth noting.
315 True ['Xerxes'] Xerxes I

The Battle of Salamis in 480 B.C. was a significant naval engagement in the Greco-Persian Wars. The Greek navies, led by Themistocles, faced off against the Persian navies under the command of King Xerxes I, who was the son of King Darius I. Despite being outnumbered, the Greek forces managed to secure a decisive victory, which marked a turning point in the war and prevented further Persian incursions into Greece.
316 False ['Air Force Quit'] The phrase you're looking for is "A nation's iced planes require a keyboard command to exit." This combines the idea of a nation's military planes getting frozen (iced planes) and the need to hit a combination of keys on your computer to exit (keyboard command to exit).
317 True ['Stevens'] Ted Stevens

The Anchorage International Airport was renamed to honor Ted Stevens, a long-serving senator from Alaska. The renaming took place in 2000, and the airport is now officially known as the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.

He was known for his advocacy for Alaska's interests and played a key role in securing federal funding for infrastructure projects in the state.
318 False ['The Way Way Back'] The Way, Way Back

The film "The Way, Way Back" is a 2013 coming-of-age comedy-drama about a 14-year-old boy named Duncan, who is on summer vacation with his mother, her overbearing boyfriend, and his daughter. The title refers to the rear-facing seat in a station wagon, specifically a 1970 Buick Estate, where Duncan often sits during their road trip. The story unfolds as Duncan finds solace and self-discovery at a local water park, where he befriends the manager and other employees.
319 False ['fenugreek'] The leaves essential to Iran's national dish, Ghormeh sabzi, are called "Persian Boy" or "European Soldier" - a type of leafy green vegetable known as "chard" or "Swiss chard" (in the US) and "spinach beet" (in the UK). However, the specific variety used in Ghormeh sabzi is called "Persian leek" or "Torshi" chard, which is a type of chard with a more intense flavor.

The confusion arises because the term "European" is not an official part of the vegetable's name, but rather a colloquial term used by some Iranians to refer to the chard plant. The term "European Soldier" is believed to have originated from the vegetable's resemblance to a soldier's uniform, with its white stalk and green leaves.

So, while the term "European" is used in the colloquial name for the vegetable, it is not an official part of its name and does not refer to a specific European nationality.
320 True ['Moldova'] Moldova

Moldova, a nation located south of Ukraine along the Danube, was part of the Soviet Union until it declared independence in 1991. Previously known as the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, it changed its name slightly to the Republic of Moldova. The country was admitted to the United Nations in 1992.
321 True ['Byrd'] Richard E. Byrd

However, Byrd began to suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning due to a malfunctioning stove and had to be rescued in 1934. He also developed frostbite during his time at the base. Despite these setbacks, Byrd continued his explorations and made significant contributions to the understanding of Antarctica.
322 True ['Broca'] Correct. The area is named after Pierre Paul Broca, a French physician, anatomist, and anthropologist. It is known as Broca's area and is located in the left frontal lobe of the brain. This region is involved in the production of speech and is crucial for language processing.

323 True ['Kim Philby'] Kim Philby

Kim Philby was a British intelligence officer who served as a double agent for the Soviet Union. He is considered one of the most successful spies in history, having passed valuable information to the Soviets for many years before his defection in 1963. Philby's life and career have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows, and it is widely believed that Graham Greene based the character of Harry Lime in "The Third Man" on Philby.

In the film adaptation of "The Third Man," Harry Lime is a charismatic and enigmatic figure who is revealed to be a ruthless black marketeer profiting from the post-war chaos in Vienna. The character has been interpreted as a commentary on the moral ambiguity of the Cold War and the dangers of espionage. Philby himself was known for his charm and intelligence, as well as his ability to deceive those around him.

While Greene never explicitly acknowledged that Harry Lime was based on Philby, the similarities between the two are striking. Both were Cambridge-educated, both worked in intelligence, and both had a reputation for being charming and duplicitous. It is likely that Greene drew inspiration from Philby's life and career when creating the character of Harry Lime.
324 True ['greenback'] The political party you're referring to is the Greenback Party, also known as the Greenback Labor Party. Formed in the United States in the 1870s, the party advocated for maintaining or increasing the amount of paper money in circulation, known as "greenbacks," which were first issued during the American Civil War. The Greenback Party believed that increasing the money supply would help farmers and laborers by making credit easier to obtain and alleviating debt burdens.
325 False ['Nutmegger'] Rhode Islanders, specifically those from the city of Newport, are sometimes referred to as "Newport Peppercorns."

This plant produces beautiful, small, pink flowers and its name ends with an "x". It's a popular choice for ground cover and in rock gardens due to its vibrant blooms. However, please ensure that you have permission to pick flowers, especially if they are growing in public spaces or on private property.

12. Catacombae (Sepulcrum Romanum) and Con Mortuis in Lingua Mortua (The Catacombs; With the Dead in a Dead Language): Inspired by Hartmann's own sketches of the Paris catacombs.
13. The Hut on Fowl's Legs (Baba Yaga): Inspired by a drawing of a clock in the shape of Baba Yaga's hut on chicken legs.
14. The Great Gate of Kiev: Inspired by Hartmann's design for an entrance gate to the city of Kiev.

329 True ['phrenology'] Phrenology

Phrenology is a pseudoscientific theory developed by Franz Joseph Gall in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It attempted to link personality traits, character, and mental abilities to the shape of the skull. According to Gall, the brain was composed of distinct "organs" or regions, each responsible for a specific personality trait or function. By examining the bumps and indentations on a person's skull, phrenologists believed they could determine the size and development of these brain regions and thus make inferences about an individual's character and abilities.

Phrenology was widely popular in the 19th century, but it was eventually discredited due to a lack of scientific evidence supporting its claims. Modern neuroscience has shown that the brain does not function in the way that phrenologists believed, and that personality and cognitive abilities are not determined by the shape of the skull.
330 True ['Czechoslovakia'] Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) did not allow the publication of Milan Kundera's second novel, "Life is Elsewhere," due to its political content.

Lorelei played the character Samantha, the daughter of the protagonist played by Ethan Hawke.
338 True ['Crossing the Bar'] The poem you're referring to is "Crossing the Bar" by Alfred Lord Tennyson. The phrase "Crossing the Bar" is sometimes used as an idiom for dying, as the poem metaphorically describes the journey of death as crossing a sandbar between the tide of life and the ocean of eternity. However, it's important to note that this usage is not as common or widely recognized as some other idioms related to death.
339 True ['Bhutan'] Bhutan

Paro Airport, located not far from the capital Thimphu in the Kingdom of Bhutan, is known for its challenging approach and landing procedures. The airport is situated in a deep valley at an elevation of 7,300 feet (2,225 meters) above sea level, surrounded by 18,000-foot (5,486-meter) peaks. Due to the complex topography, pilots must navigate the aircraft manually in daylight and good weather conditions, as there is no radar or instrument landing system available. This makes Paro Airport one of the most challenging airports to land in the world.

341 True ['atom'] The "Plum Pudding" model, proposed by J.J. Thomson, was an early attempt to describe the internal structure of the atom. In this model, the atom was thought to be a positively charged sphere (the "pudding") with negatively charged electrons (the "plums") embedded within it. However, this model was replaced by the planetary model, also known as the Rutherford model, proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. In the planetary model, the atom is composed of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus orbited by negatively charged electrons, similar to planets orbiting a star.

This play revolves around the ruthless and ambitious Hubbard family in a small Alabama town at the turn of the 20th century.

347 False ['Histrionic'] The article refers to FDR's ability to deliver "unexpected" speeches, which were dramatic and engaging. This ability was considered valuable in politics as it helped him connect with the public and convey his messages effectively.
